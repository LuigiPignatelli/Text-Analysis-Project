0,27_emilys,"When I get depressed, I tend to get impulsive. So ""pampering"" myself quickly turns into opening up a credit card &amp; loading a couple hundred dollars on it. I'm broke as shit right now now that I'm going back to school, so pretty much all I do with my free time anymore is loaf around at home.

Human interaction definitely helps me too. It's just so hard getting out there in the first place when my brain is screaming that everyone hates me.",1,2018-04-10
1,27_emilys,"I never understood the whole ""inherent human worth"" thing. If I'm just laying around all day, barely passing my classes, how am I worth anything? I feel like everyone is going to see how much of a failure I am &amp; abandon me in time.",1,2018-04-10
2,27_emilys,"A lot of girls tend to get attention for it, but I know some guys do it to. I wonder if guys are more likely to seek out other self-destructive behaviors, such as alcoholism &amp; drug addiction, while girls tend to take the more direction methods of cutting/burning? That's a bit of a generalization, though. &amp; yes, I'm a girl.

I was playing Zelda on my DS yesterday because my boyfriend bought it for me &amp; was at work all day &amp; I had off. I found it really fun last week, but yesterday I literally could not concentrate on it &amp; just turned it off &amp; lay down. Today will probably be a repeat of that. Maybe I can convince myself to eat.",1,2018-04-10

11,27_emilys,"Thank you for responding. I definitely agree that toughing through one little task at a time helps. I just get overwhelmed so easily &amp; I stress myself out. I feel so guilty for feeling that way towards my partner. But also, I feel like I have to go back for us so that we have a chance at a maybe better life.

Doctors definitely are a pain though! I've went through so many who simply didnt understand what I was going through. My first psychiatrist was the worst. I never felt she cared about what I was saying, only adjusting my medication based upon my mood. I just want someone who talks to me like a person, not a mental patient. If that makes sense.",2,2018-07-03

18,27_emilys,"Yep! I generally hate everyone. Including myself. Pretty much only care about one person. But when we're out at social events, I'm closed off. It's like I have this cynical bitch living in my head, feeding me negativity at the smallest things.

26,AcademicTrash__,"If it’s not too personal, can I ask why you what led to the some of the fights that you guys had? Was it a trivial matter or something else? I’m constantly arguing and fighting with this girl, and I keep trying to fix it and stay calm but the same shit constantly keeps happening over and things aren’t really getting better. Honestly I have no idea how to deal with these fights the right way. At this point it could really go either ways; she could leave or we could stay as friends. Any advice on how to deal with constant fights? Did you guys constantly fight about the same subject matter like me and my friend?",2,2018-12-27
27,AcademicTrash__,"It's okay to be selfish sometimes. Is it a crime that your life is going downhill and you feel hopeless everyday? Is it a crime that you don't want to feel hurt? Fuck no. At some point, suicide seems like the most sensible thing to do.

28,AcademicTrash__,"Idk much about it but can't you deal with body hair with laser??? You should look into it and get it as soon as you can if you feel that insecure about body hair. 

As for looks...as self-conscious as I can be and probably you might be too, there's more people than you think that are kind, overlook your looks and aren't judgmental every second. Take advantage of that. And come on, I know it's hard but there's ALWAYS so many things you can work on to improve yourself or to improve your self-confidence or crazy goals to strive for. Stay motivated. Don't lose hope. Your worst days will get better and even when things are bad there can always be one or two hopeful spots in your day.

127,ArialB,"Xanax has really helped me. During the day I have to get up and do stuff, I’ll make a list. So I’ll take a Xanax to get through it then right when i get home I’ll take a sleeping pill, so I can do the same thing the next day. 
Maybe you should talk to your doctor about that. Anxiety meds like that helps me feel numb enough to function. 
I know what you mean though. I’m in college so I don’t see him at school every day, but it’s hard to watch him on social media having fun and doing his thing while I’m over here so depressed I can’t get out of bed in the morning.

I thought loneliness was the most terrible feeling, but for me personally, love being ripped away from you is the worst possible pain I’ve ever experienced. Hearing “I don’t love you and every little love I’ve ever had for you is gone” is the worst thing I’ve ever heard. 
I’d rather have no experienced any kind of love than to have it dangled in my face, then ripped away. I can’t explain how horrible it is but it’s made me suicidal.

135,Mozartmoonlight,"Yes. I don't want her to start acting 'cured' for my peace of mind. At all. If she's depressed because I make too little money for her taste and am bad at sex and she can't say it out of courtesy, I want to know it. If a year off work is needed, I'm here for it. If moving to another city helps. I'll move with her. If it involves gory details around sexual abuse or desire to kill parents, I'm fine with that; I won't judge. Am I the main reason for the depression? I want to know this and what I did to cause it, even though the solutions to this breaks my heart. If she wants to do things I disapprove of in order to feel happy, I'm here for it. I don't care if this person I love becomes a Bible-thumping evangelical who represents all that I dislike (I'm wondering about these words as I type) -- I ***do*** want her to be \*\*alive\*\* and content with herself (notice not ""happy"", just non-suicidal, and a capacity to feel real joy in her heart would be a great bonus) not ever spend even an hour of her life thinking of harming herself. I'm not all that sane either, but never in my worst moments do I think of ending this life which biology will end anyway.

149,Mozartmoonlight,"Thank you for saying this, but I feel like you've misread what I said. I am NOT saying ""because someone else *has it* worse"". That is completely different from what I'm saying. I'm saying some awful people *ARE* worse individuals (judge me if you want), like the kind to actively promote genocide and feel no guilt or shame about it. What I'm saying is it seems so wrong (as in, not SHE's wrong, the *SITUATION* is wrong) that she would feel pain and misery when, to me, she is a good human being who deserves not to feel that level of pain. Obviously not all is going to be rainbows and roses but I would like her to feel like her life is meaningful and well-lived. Maybe my life looks stupid to others but I don't generally feel like dying and I'd like her to also feel similarly unburdened of the thought of self-harm. 

My comment can mean, look at this great person who did all the right things, worked hard and still got demoted, while that guy who broke laws and harassed interns and stole a thick stack of money just got promoted.

Look, even I get traumatized over things that seem small and irrelevant to others. I'm just trying to say that it seems unjust that she suffer when other much more evil people don't (judge me if you want but it is my belief that some people are, as a matter of irrefutable fact, evil a-holes). That's just my honest feeling. I'm sorry that it came across as judgmental. I'm not saying she's wrong. I'm saying the situation sucks and I want it to be better.

156,Mozartmoonlight,"Thanks for the advice. Here's my dilemma. I **hate** being bossed around personally and can't ask other grown adults with personal autonomy to do things like a Mom would. My partner (who also suffers from severe depression but deals with it better) will stand at her bedside, briskly order her out of bed and turn the lights on but I can't do that somehow without feeling really rude. When I tell her the first time ""hey can you please help me to cook"" and she says ""yes, OK"" but doesn't get out of bed, I take that as a solid ""No, screw you, I don't wanna cook"" and I don't push her further (she got up 2hrs later, said sorry, panicked and tried to help but dinner was ready by then...). I think adults should be allowed the self-determination to make their own choices and really feel uncomfortable telling a late-20s woman to do basic stuff like drink water and help clean up.

I think I will have to talk to her about it. Thankfully she got up the next morning at a reasonable time. I feel just really weird and divided. On the one hand when she's well, she's way more charismatic than me and has a loyal group of friends, is way more social than I ever will be. But when she's down (2-3 times a week), I have to ask her to drink water and remind her to eat. Part of me feels like the best thing is to leave things alone and let her do all that on her own schedule. But another part of me feels like that would be irresponsible to leave alone someone who is sick and needs water/food to survive. She told me too, months ago, she realizes that's not my responsibility to keep her alive but we never talked about what the expectations are, if she finds my ""hey remember to drink water"" (I had to tell her 3 times yesterday before she'd get up) . So a confrontation (gentle one) may be in order. Does she expect me to do this stuff as a friend? Or am I supposed to respect her personal space when she's depressed?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't relate very easily to this stuff because I think actions speak louder than words. A lot of times, she says ""Oh I'll help with X"" but can't do it because of depression, and she'll say ""Yes"" but gets around to things around the time it's already 90% done.

159,Mozartmoonlight,"You actually have friends and family &amp; a home, which is very fortunate for you from the POV of people who have nobody.

The reality is it does deeply stress out other people who care about you when you neglect yourself and give up. So, no, it's *not* just your problem because it affects everyone who cares. I don't think you understand what it's like to care for depressed people. Imagine your mom or dad doing exactly what you did and them asking you to just leave you alone. I live with people with severe depression and I know that if things really go to s\*\*t, **they'll be the ones** all complaining, ""oh why didn't anyone help me! No one cares!"" when people have been trying to help all along. So at the very least, move out and find your own apartment if you truly want to be left alone.

Even then, though, you are in a situation that a lot of people would envy, to have people actually check on you.

It's like blaming someone for their own flu symptoms. I can't blame someone for not being able to run 10K due to a bad knee, etc. And yes, life does happen and I also had a really negative slump before so get when someone just needs leeway. I am a bit bitter because I've spent thousands of dollars on therapy dealing with some of the resentment she triggers in me, which again has to do with my own pettiness. 

It's not shift work. It's more like get this project done on time type work. But it's delicate. I have to be nice because - well, I have to be. I'll do for her what I can.

166,Mozartmoonlight,"Thanks for the heartfelt advice. I will talk to my spouse about ways to concretely help. Part of the challenge is I need to confront the small-mindedness and pettiness in my self. I am the type that never asks for help if I can do it myself (for example, lifting heavy boxes - yes, a man can do it with greater ease but I can't respect myself if I 'm not doing all that i can humanly do with my own power) so I am weirdly offended when I see someone acting the way she does, which is the polar opposite of how I do things. I've been told my way of thinking is very un-feminine and I've been trying to reconcile this like some kind of Jungian shadow.

172,OliSoul,"I know your depression is bad. You don't need to have a horrible life to have horrible depression. Your paranoia and past relationships are probably causing you to not want to trust being with someone again. It must be terrifying, I want to say it gets better. However, the only way it can get better is if you try to make it better. I've had depression since I was six, sure I still have my bad days, but at the end of the day I remind myself that there will always be tomorrow. If something goes wrong today, tomorrow could always be better. A bad day doesn't equal a bad life. You're depressed or any mental health issues doesn't control your life, it doesn't decide who you are, and it most certainly doesn't make you into something bad. School can be stressful, but it's not everything. I don't know what to say about the weed thing, but I'm sure you'll figure something out. I'm sure your family will love you no matter what, and if your girlfriend loves you too then she'll love you no matter what.

182,OliSoul,"I lost my grandma about two years ago. I visited her every week to check on her and made sure she had someone to talk to. She had stage 4 lung cancer and they gave her six months at most, but she made it a year. One week I didn't get to see her, because I had to bring my nephews out of town for my brother-in-law's mother's funeral. The morning after we made it to his mother's hometown my mother got a call that my grandma had passed. I was devastated. And angry, mostly because no one bothered to let me know. I know she loved me and I know she's still there to make sure I'm okay.

 I'm so sorry for your loss, your mother sounds like she was a wonderful woman. Like others said here, live for her. But don't just live, take care of yourself. Even if you don't feel like eating, try to have something small and keep having water. Just because you are living for her, doesn't mean she would have wanted you to waste away not caring about yourself. Remember, she loved you so much and she wants you and the rest of your family to have a good life. Take care of yourself and your family. It will take time, and the pain will get easier. It will still be there, but you'll look back and remember how she was and how much love she brought to you and everyone. Please, for her, take care of your life. Also, you should talk to someone, even other family members about how you're feeling, you can't hold it in, that wouldn't be what she would have wanted.

Again, I'm so sorry. She loved you and no matter what, she will always be there to watch over you.",1,2019-10-30

I've had 6 therapists in my life and the only one that helped couldn't keep me as a patient, because I was no longer under 18 (child and young adult therapist).

It just makes me feel invalid as a human. I'm doing everything for everyone and no one even bats an eye, but whenever someone else I know does something small it's rewarded and everyone thinks they're so great.

I came here looking for ways to manage without self harming, not to be diagnosed. We've had many doctors assume it was stress, until they read my medical history. My family doctor told me it was not stress, and that's why I'm getting tests done. He's thinking ulcers or polyps. I do not need a diagnosis from randoms on the internet, I was asking for safer habits instead of harming myself. So please, do not assume shit.

 “Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person's skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.” 

 “To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.”",1,2019-12-10

This next step is hard. Lay down (fetal position is best for comfort. I personally cradle my forehead with my hand, as though I was taking my own temperature). Close your eyes and sleep.

The comedown is shit but it's not forever. It's only a few hours to go. Wank if that helps but do not give in to any temptation or intrusive thoughts.

Mate, it sucks. I know but it isn't forever because you can change this. I know you've heard this 1000 times over but you have your whole life to meet people. The people I knew at 19/20 are no longer in my life. I have one friend who I see maybe once a month and that makes me happy. I was lucky enough to know him since we were 6 but we only met back up a few years ago (24?). You'll find people on here, at work just out and about man I promise you. But you need to put yourself out there. It's hard being prisoned by your own self. It's even worse with an addiction. Please don't let that take over.

The loss of my friendships was especially difficult to take, as we were friends for over 15 years. I miss them in a way, but the situation that took place disgusted me so much with them I don't miss them too. I just miss having someone to talk to who fully understands me. ",1,2017-02-08

545,Yvanne,"It’s really bad since this kind of mindset leads you to consuming short term distractions like youtube or whatever and can easily lead you down a hole. 
I think it’s super important to develop a schedule, any kind of schedule, so that you at least are mentally occupied... having nothing to do all day takes a huge toll on your mental state.. and it sucks when you see yourself slowly slipping away.

548,Yvanne,"Hey man... sometimes life can feel very hopeless, and I get the whole feeling of trying to wrestle with external forces (family, school, whatever). But try and look at it in a different way... use those problems as motivation. Motivation to say, ‘fuck you x, I’m going to live my own life’.

when you finally get to that day when things feel ‘alright’ you can look at your past problems as part of what made you who you are today.

I’m feeling pretty down so if I say some brash things take it with a grain of salt’ is fine.

587,Zonta1,I didn’t have a sex drive before the antidepressant was introduced. I just find it harder to orgasm and less far less pleasurable now.

602,Zonta1,"Look man I’m not denying that we didn’t eat meat to survive, but the hunter gatheres had a plethora of diseases such as atherosclerosis because they ate meat, they lived shorter lives, we have a long stomach we are herbivores not carnivores just because we can eat meat doesn’t mean we should it’s literally bad for our health, and I just hope you can realise that now instead of in the future",1,2020-04-03
603,Zonta1,"Just because we ate meat doesn’t mean we need it to survive, so that debunks the whole argument of I need meat to survive, you can have  a perfectly balanced diet and get all your essential amino acids from plant based foods along with all the protein you need with out mass murdering animals that your eating and also wiping out total species to extinction in the Amazon because we need more land so we can farm corn and stuff to feed the cattle that your eating, if I know one thing in my opinion humans came to earth to love it not to destroy it it’s because of cognitive dissonance people know it’s bad but they don’t give a fuck because they believe the lies of society that you need it for a balanced diet, that it’s healthy when in fact meat is carcinogenic and causes a lot of diseases, heart attacks, cardiovascular disease diabetes, erectile dysfunction the list goes on, also contributing to global warming because more than half of the green house gases come from live animal stock",1,2020-04-03
604,Zonta1,"I feel this I never excercise from it thankfully I’m a vegan so I don’t have to worry about my calories so I won’t get fat from not excercising but just my day yo day activities are hard like if I’m lying down I have to sit up first before I stand up because my body just feels so heavy I also get dizzy when I stand and sometimes I have manual heavy breathing, do you get this?",1,2020-04-03
605,Zonta1,Confront them definitely life’s about sharing how you feel so don’t be ashamed of what you feel this is good because you can vent,1,2020-04-04

607,Zonta1,This is just my point of view you got a big heart but I can’t see any advice to give you as your in lock down and it sounds like your doing the best you can maybe just talk to your roommate and tell them how you feel and that your sorry atleast then they can see that you care but than just leave it at that like at the end of the day your going through your own shit and it’s beautiful that your thinking of how your actions impact your roommate like my mum always said to me it’s the thought that counts but like you can’t take the whole world on your shoulders in this situation your doing your best okay :)?,1,2020-04-04

609,Zonta1,"I’ll start off by saying are you on medication? 

Also look that’s awesome that you got goals man but the only person putting pressure on yourself is you, do what makes you happy man for me it’s being on reddit all day haha because that’s all I enjoy at this stage in life I suggest go with the flow and just find something to occupy your time with even if your in bed all day find something in bed to do on your phone or tv or laptop that gives you meaning I stay connected through reddit and try give other people advice and hope and it keeps me fighting everyday even when I’m completely low.",1,2020-04-04

But you could also look at it like if there not putting in effort then don’t worry about them because it should be a two way street.

I’ll tell you my story so I’m very alone I don’t socialise unless people text me That’s because of my illness I dunno if the person your talking to or people your talking to are like me or not? 

Maybe just be honest just say how you feel to them after all it’s best not to hide from your emotions and if they treat you like dirt for opening up to them how you feel then where they really worth it anyway? Atleast opening up you get to see what they truly think?",1,2020-04-04
611,Zonta1,"Hey bro let’s just make it clear that your still young as fuck hahaha I know it doesn’t feel like that because you haven’t had any experience with woman and a social life, what I will say is there’s plenty of time to meet people especially when you get a job, and now I’m not saying you getting a job will be the main reason you attract friends, but it’s a fact that making good money I’m assuming you will after you finish uni will give you opportunities to create a family and meet women because you can provide and that’s a sexy thing, just keep focusing on yourself, maybe get yourself out there start joining social groups what are you interested in ? If it’s church join your church social group if it’s excercise join a fitness class get to know people do this at your own pace I know you said your introvertered and quiet so am I it’s okay, but if you push your boundaries slowly you can get out there one day at a time you have the no power to change your life man and when you realise that you can become unstoppable",1,2020-04-04

616,Zonta1,"I see yeah that could be over kill, ofcourse you feel like this no doubt, I’m not going to say it’s truly temporary because I’m not a fortune teller or god, but I will say have hope that it is temporary because it’s a possibility that she will talk to you properly again and things will be good, other than that are you doing your best to look after your mental health, eating healthy, not doing drugs, alcohol or cigarettes and relying on them as a scaling goat as these can exacerbate things, do you have a good social network of friends off her family members you can talk to ? Excercising? These are all pillars to health as I remember god grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference, focus on yourself and what you can do for you",1,2020-04-04
617,Zonta1,I understand hand writing letters means more to you so you should do it but I’m afraid she might throw it away and that will all be for nothing in that case I suggest writing a letter and texting both the same things that way if she deletes the texts and throws out the letter you have the text on your end so you could just resend it to her when she wants to talk to you like a mature adult,1,2020-04-04
618,Zonta1,"Thanks man, I’m on antipsychotic medication for starters, I’ve had two episodes and have only ever had breakthrough symptoms twice since I have been on medication for about a year and 3 months now I just know that before medication I was suicidal but I enjoyed life more than I do now I feel like I’ve had a lobotomy a chemical one from the antipsychotics and I’d rather function without the meds because I think it’s more natural, everything I experience as well is all guilt based and low self astern and has to do with my behaviour choices I don’t experience random voices or halluncations that have no emotional context to me it’s all real delusions possible explanations to me and even other people have told me that so I’m not just saying that, the only problem I have is I have really bad memory issues and I don’t socialise much at all!!! Because of my communication issues I have zero attention span like when I read or watch tv I have a hard time getting the gist of what’s being said I based my diagnoses o schizophrenia around the cognitive issues that I have but they are also in depression?",1,2020-04-04

620,Zonta1,"Honestly virgins are looked up to in society it’s quite the opposite that’s a really special thing especially in the eyes of god, I’d suggest find a a girl you will be committed to and lose it to her it will be more worth it as you will have an emotional connection.",1,2020-04-04
621,Zonta1,"what’s important is you don’t get angry even tho you are because that could aggravate the situation even more, I’d suggest sending her one big long message and write your whole heart into it and start off at the top of the message saying Something like I know your angry at me and you don’t have to respond I just want you to read this because I want to let you know how I feel, that way you come in on a more diplomatic way and get her on your side, if you send multiple messages she’s likely to not read them all especially if you don’t come in and start off by saying what I told you to write, and end the message by saying something like when your ready to talk to me I’m here for you because your my daughter and I love you more than anything just be authentic loving be you :) hopefully I have you something to think about",1,2020-04-04
622,Zonta1,"Haha I don’t know if your being sarcastic? Bro if I could go back to being in high school again I would have turned down drugs I started on drugs at the age of 13 and I now have a mental illness now I’m not saying my mental illness purely came from the drugs and stuff but I can damn say it heavily contributed, I’d suggest find a loving gentle girl who will love you for you that’s what true happiness is not fucking a bunch of sluts but that’s my opinion you get bored after a while someone you can grow with is a beautiful thing, I have fucked more girls than i can count I actually lost count but what’s more important to me is my relationship with god and I’d honestly rather just find a special woman and get married and have kids and set a life up with",1,2020-04-04
623,Zonta1,"I know it’s heartbreaking because I spoke to my mum after I remended our relationship and she said it hurt her a lot when I cut her off so I understand you feel in pain.
I honestly think your daughter is just being young and a little immature, I’d consider venting to her and tell her how you truly feel because that’s what makes us human standing up for what we think is right and not letting people no matter who they are walk over us",1,2020-04-04

625,Zonta1,"I’d suggest not drink alcohol smoke weed or cigarettes and even stay away from prescription pills, I suggest this because all of those things if they get to a stage of abuse they have been known to increase suicide risk by heaps so if your already depressed I’d suggest stay clear",1,2020-04-04
626,Zonta1,"She’s young and could be going through that stage, I cut communication off with my mum for heaps of reasons it didn’t last long and I was back talking to her so this could be temporary, also why is she angry at your shit?

639,Zonta1,"Okay, I’d be very careful with medication because a side effect of medication psych drugs in fact is they can make you feel worse right off and more suicidal kinda ironic huh how society looks for a magic pill.

Yeah that’s exactly right bro, people like to say things can get worse or things can get better there both true it just depends on which one of those statements you want to look forward to because one good day can make 365 days feel like nothing so have hope bro :) 

Sounds like it could be the medication, porn can cause erectile dysfunction because it’s so much dopamine, basically dairy eggs and meat causes inflammation in the body and clogs arteries and milk lowers tesosterone in males because it has real esterogen that gets used by our body I’d suggest drinking soy milk instead,",1,2020-04-05

643,Zonta1,"I like to think it’s a fact I currently hate the way I feel about life now but I like to think I can’t prove that it will never get better so that’s why I hang around because there’s always an opportunity that comes up tomorrow, that’s what’s kept me alive for years",1,2020-04-05

I have to watch him be successful going to university, having tonnes of friends, enjoying his job,and he just LOVES life. meanwhile here I am, the complete shit of the family, no job or friends, don't go anywhere or do anything except drink at night.

649,iliterallydontexist,"&gt;When i vent to my friends all i get is ""oof"" or ""rip"". Oh well

Holy shit

100% same here

It's such a lazy repsonse because all they have to do is ready the first few words of your text to recognize it's a depressing text and all they have to say is that typical bullshit ""oof"" shit and they can pretend they read your whole text while pretending to ahve sympathy.

MEANWHILE 

When they do the same thing to me, I genuinely empathize with everything they say, to try to vicariously experience their emotions so I can give a proper response, and I think through actual tips to help them get through their situation.",1,2019-03-08

651,iliterallydontexist,"It's not the memory you are working for, the memory isn't the end goal. It's a constant thing you need to do for your body in order to feel alive/fulfilled. It's like food. ",1,2019-04-05
652,iliterallydontexist,I wish I could play a video game and temporarily forget all my worries. I put a game on (something I've been excited about all my life and I finally get it) and I play it for a few minutes or hours and I just think about how shitty my life is the whole time and stop playing entirely.,1,2019-04-05
653,iliterallydontexist,"It's not really about getting to the peak. It's an excuse to get out of the house, breathe in the fresh air and all the interesting smells accompanied with nature. It's about getting the much needed exercise providing rich oxygen to your brain and your internal organs; physically calming your body especially when your tight and anxious/stressed finally making you feel alive. It's about hitting the summit and admiring the view, spending some time on the top, meditating and contemplating life a bit, then heading back down and going home. 

When you get home it's different than just sitting around all day or just going to work/school and going straight home because you feel alive and like you experienced a type of success - that you did something today and your body and mind are temporarily better for it. As a bonus, you can even tell somebody about your day and they'll think slightly higher of you (not that their opinion matters) making you feel even better. It's something you don't really forget.

All this, coming from somebody who is and has been extremely depressed and suicidal for a few years. I've never climbed a mountain in my life. But I imagine this would be the experience, and this is why people do it.",2,2019-04-05
654,iliterallydontexist,"No it's just the action of it. It takes 20/25 minutes from set-up, to before-shower, to shower, to post-shower, to clean-up. My ears get wet after a shower and that often causes them to clog up and causes hearing damage and ear infections. Moving everything into the bathroom and then drying it off and putting it all back in my room after. Then I have to find clean clothes and take the towel downstairs. ",1,2019-04-06

657,iliterallydontexist,"Yeah same completely. I'm trying to make things better.... or rather.. I *want* to make things better but 1. I don't know how because I wasn't raised how to live life properly and 2. even if I do know exactly what to do, my social anxiety kicks in and puts me down. Whatever, I already have my method of suicide realized, I'm just waiting for my life to get that last little bit worse to do it. I just don't want my family to walk in on me like that. Yeah you read that right, I'm 30 and living with my mommy and daddy. Fucking pathetic :/",1,2019-04-06
658,iliterallydontexist,"&gt; Hot showers are one of the most relaxing things you can do for yourself. 

Yeah I absolutely do not experience this. Showers are incredibly stressful for me so I avoid them as much as possible. Dry shampoo is my best friend. I only shower about once a week because my crotch starts developing a rotting rash with smell so I have to shower to try to get rid of it. It's awful.

Also having long hair makes everything so much worse because it takes longer to wash and it takes forever to dry.",1,2019-04-06

I could write the excuses for why I forgot but in reality I was just caught up in my own life. It doesn't mean I don't love my uncle though.

700,ineedanewthrowawy,"Can't help ya much with that little info friend. I can say you're not alone though. That I'm sad too, and that I wish you the best luck in finding something to cheer you up or distract you. Hell, take a walk at night and smoke a cigarette for me since I can't walk anymore. I've never felt more at peace than when I've done that. If you hate smoking or something then just take the walk and listen to some music.",1,2017-08-19
701,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sorry to hear that. I can relate. I went to Europe with my mother and sister and they were going 100 miles an hour the whole trip, and I was just fucking exhausted. All I wanted to do was sleep. Sometimes at night though after they were asleep, I had a little time for myself and there was one night I'll never forget. We were in Austria so it was lightly snowing and just so peaceful at night. I grabbed a cigarette (bad habit I know) and stepped outside and walked around for 10 minutes. I have never felt that way before. It was just so beautiful under the streetlights that I finally had a moment of peace after nonstop traveling. Try to find some time to be by yourself on this trip and compose yourself. Notice the beauty in everything around you and how it contrasts with how you feel and where you normally are. Hope you can have a nice moment on your vacation bro. Good luck, let yourself enjoy it, you deserve it.",3,2017-08-19

704,ineedanewthrowawy,"I go through periods when it just seems like there's nothing good to eat. I'm diabetic, so I have to eat a regular amount, otherwise I will have low blood sugar due to what they call background insulin. I usually snap out of it eventually and one thing that will always be good to me is a chicken fried steak. Maybe you have a food that never fails to hit the spot as well. I don't know, good luck though, try to stay healthy.",3,2017-08-19
705,ineedanewthrowawy,"I smoked for a long time too my friend. Recently I had surgery and I decided I wasn't going to smoke until I start physical therapy. It's been about a month and I'm definitely not in a situation to get my mind off my problems, but I still feel like shit. I just feel like shit about things other than how much weed I smoke and how it's ruining my life. I think you should set a goal. If you can make it 2 months without smoking you may find that the boredom pushes you to try something new. If you find a hobby or a group of friends you may not feel the urge to smoke as powerfully as before. Good luck.",1,2017-08-23
706,ineedanewthrowawy,"That's rough man. To me it seems like it's easy to maintain a life once you have one but starting from scratch feels impossible. When I can finally walk again, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.",1,2017-08-24
707,ineedanewthrowawy,"I really feel for you man. I am in a much less life changing situation than you but I can somewhat relate. I broke my leg very badly (dr nearly had to amputate) and I'm type 1 diabetic so it is taking a long time to heal. I haven't walked in 7 months and have now skipped 2 semesters. I will likely never be able to walk normally or run again. I know it's different, but I know what it's like to feel like your life got stopped in it's tracks. I truly wish you the best of luck and as fast of a recovery as possible. All I can recommend is to quit whatever bad habits you have while you're out. I used my injury as motivation to quit smoking, and at least while I'm out, drinking. There's a lot of bad that comes with a horrible injury, but try to make the most of it. It's the only thing that keeps me sane.",1,2017-08-30

710,ineedanewthrowawy,Definitely not you’re fault man. If there weren’t a gun around he would have found another way to do it. He made a choice that you and you’re family have to deal with for the rest of your lives. I wish you the best of luck. ,23,2017-10-06

714,ineedanewthrowawy,"I quit cutting altogether when I broke the shit out of my ankle, almost lost my foot. I knew that it was going to take so long to heal, and I didn’t want to do anything that would slow it down. I remember before I had a skin graft, they told me they were taking skin from my thigh, near my scars. I was so scared that my parents might notice them that I decided to never cut again. It’s been 8 months and I’m finally starting to walk again. By now, the urges to cut myself have been almost totally replaced by the urge to drink and smoke. I wish we could find better outlets for our pain, lmk if you find one.",2,2017-10-10
715,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah it can be pretty rough dealing with loneliness. I was lucky enough to have gotten into skateboarding before I was too depressed, and that helped me maintain some friends.

718,ineedanewthrowawy,"Hey just letting you know I’m right where you are. Not tonight, but some nights. If you need to talk just pm me. I don’t give a fuck about anything so I don’t judge haha. Good luck.",1,2017-10-10
719,ineedanewthrowawy,I can hardly walk anyway anymore. Count me the fuck in.,7,2017-10-10
720,ineedanewthrowawy,I saw that too haha. I am going to try to skate flatground and hope I can do some tranny. But my true love was hand rails.,1,2017-10-13
721,ineedanewthrowawy,"I broke my ankle really badly 8 months ago. Nearly lost my foot twice while it’s been healing and have had 3 surgeries including a skin graft. Most likely will never be able to run again. But thankfully, I am at least starting to walk again.",1,2017-10-13
722,ineedanewthrowawy,I broke my ankle really badly and almost lost my foot twice while it was healing. 8 months later I’m starting to walk again but I’ll most likely have a limp and swelling for the rest of my life.,3,2017-10-13
723,ineedanewthrowawy,"If there weren’t anyone who cared about me at least I could kill myself. I’m sorry to be unhelpful to you, I’m just really bitter. I care about you because I’m lonely too and we’re alike in that way. So if you want to pm me you can, I’ll talk to anyone.",1,2017-10-13
724,ineedanewthrowawy,Me too. It sucks when I have good dreams. It’s even worse when I have dreams of good times from the past. Waking up from that and realizing I’m still in the present just makes me want to shoot myself. ,1,2017-10-13
725,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yup, and going to bed is invigorating. Which keeps me up late.",22,2017-10-16
726,ineedanewthrowawy,Definitely jokes. Also I don’t really know how not to hide it anymore. On especially bad days I’m just quiet. Most days I just talk about whatever the person I’m with is interested in and forget about my own life for a little bit.,2,2017-10-16
727,ineedanewthrowawy,My favorite fucking thing ever is smoking a cigarette out in “shitty” dreary weather. Just made it all better for a few minutes.,1,2017-10-16
728,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sorry to hear you’re going through that. I can’t imagine how hard that must be. I’m rooting for you, good luck getting through this shit.",1,2017-10-16
729,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah, that’s how it’s been for a while for me too. Let’s just be cowards and stick around until something kills us.",4,2017-10-16
730,ineedanewthrowawy,It’s the worst. Totally miserable being like that. The only think that fixes it for me is being drunk enough that I can’t think straight. Which is just another horrible habit.,1,2017-10-16
731,ineedanewthrowawy,"Thanks but I’ll be ok. I have friends I can talk to if I need to, I just don’t. Was hoping this girl would be different maybe. I’m already low enough that another step down won’t do much to me overall. Just feels shitty I waited for a while.",1,2017-10-18
732,ineedanewthrowawy,Yessir,3,2017-10-18
733,ineedanewthrowawy,I just don’t get it,1,2017-10-18

735,ineedanewthrowawy,"I lost my taste for most music. Now it has to have a dramatic and melancholy tune. My favorite song right now is “about you” by xxyyxx. I hope you give it a listen till the end, it’s a little surprising.",1,2017-10-20
736,ineedanewthrowawy,"Me too. I have a medical reason so it’s actually been 9 for me. Now that I’m able to get back into the real world again, I find that it still doesn’t make me feel normal. It sure as hell doesn’t make me feel whole. But it does make me feel a little better, which is amazing after so long. Whatever your reason is, I hope that you get back out there soon. You’ve got a life to live. Even if it’s shitty or scary, the only thing that can make it better is you, actively trying to make it better. Best of luck to you.",1,2017-10-21
737,ineedanewthrowawy,Exactly. I took it one step farther and did other drugs when the weed wasn’t around or wasn’t enough. It’s a deep dark hole you can get sucked into if you’re not careful.,2,2017-10-21
738,ineedanewthrowawy,"That’s great. But I’m going to warn you right now, it doesn’t last forever. When I first started smoking I thought the same thing, “this is amazing! I can talk to girls and things are funny again.” A couple years later I was definitely in a different place, but not necessarily a better one. I wasn’t a virgin anymore, I was actually somewhat popular and went to parties, and I was a better skater than ever before. But, I smoked every single day, I drank nearly every day, and I didn’t give a shit about my grades. A year after that, I got into other kinds of drugs, blow, acid, robitussin, lean, adderal Xanax, Percocet, and of course, cigarettes. If it was around, I was down to do it. Nowadays I’ve cleaned up my act quite a bit but I was in a dark place for a while there. It led to fun times but horrible mental and physical health as well. I still smoke weed and get hard cravings for alcohol because I know those things numb the pain, and I wish I had learned better coping mechanisms when I was younger. Weed’s ok, but use it to have a good time, and not too often. If it becomes your way of dealing with pain, one day it just won’t feel like you’re numb enough, and you’ll want the next step up. Best of luck to you. ",2,2017-10-21
739,ineedanewthrowawy,Good for you man. Quitting cigarettes is one of the hardest things for me to do. In fact I still smoke when others offer them to me. But the cravings get less intense the longer you go without. Best of luck to you.,2,2017-10-21
740,ineedanewthrowawy,I feel that. I’d rather be in a fucking horror movie than my current situation.,5,2017-10-21
741,ineedanewthrowawy,"That’s rough. Thankfully I never got too into any kind of pills but I did get addicted to cigarettes and to a lesser extent alcohol. I know it’s probably not as hard or serious to quit cigarettes as benzos but it sure is a bitch. I’ve quit them about 5 times and never totally stick with it. I have cut down to just one every couple days though. I wish you the best of luck with this. I understand how hard it is to not take something when it’s readily available to you. I hope you don’t go too much farther down this path of addiction because it’s not something that’s worth putting money and time into. One day you’re going to meet a girl/guy who you really like and likes you, and you’re going to have to either try to quit, hide the problem, or she/he will find out. The obvious answer is to hide the problem but it’s a lot damn harder than you imagine it will be. ",1,2017-11-08
742,ineedanewthrowawy,"That’s a late reply haha, yeah that’s a group that can capture the feeling for sure. Sometimes it’s hard to find music that sounds as sad as I feel.",1,2017-11-22
743,ineedanewthrowawy,"People tell me the same thing. It's true, most of the time I am good but every once in a while I do something shitty that proves the opposite, at least to me. Maybe the fact that we try to be good makes us better than some? I don't know, the way I see it I'm just tricking everyone so they're nice to me. Now that I put it into words I sound like a lunatic. Guess I already knew I'm mentally ill. Good luck to you, I bet you're an ok guy who's harder on himself than most people are.",1,2017-11-30
744,ineedanewthrowawy,"I can relate in that I wish I could wake up as someone else every day. I fucked up in many ways myself, the biggest one being that I crippled myself. I would trade bodies with almost anyone to be able to run and play with my dog again. I still have friends and I guess people tend to like me ok. I get told I'm good looking sometimes but it's hard to give a shit when I'm standing (sitting most of the time) in my shoes. The grass is always greener right? Good luck to you, I don't follow my own advice but i know the best thing to do is make the best of what you have.",2,2017-11-30
745,ineedanewthrowawy,"I've tried to make deals with God and the devil to go back in time on multiple occasions. If they're real, they don't offer that service. Sorry it has to be this way. I've said it before. I would do anything to go back, anything at all.",5,2017-11-30
746,ineedanewthrowawy,"I've thought that exact same thing lol. Maybe everyone's just in hell together and no one knows it. Like that's part of the fun, the devil is just laughing his ass off at all of us pieces of shit trying to be happy in a world that's made for just the opposite.",6,2017-12-04
747,ineedanewthrowawy,"Hey I'm sorry to hear you're feeling that way. I got hurt pretty bad a while back and now I walk with a limp and can't run or jump or stand for very long. I don't think people look at me like I'm an alien but it sure makes me feel different from everyone else, so were kind of alike there. I'm sorry I don't really have anything to say to make you feel better, but I just wanted to let you know you're not alone in feeling alone haha. I hope things start looking up for you and me soon. Good luck!",1,2017-12-04
748,ineedanewthrowawy,"Well I hate the shit out of myself too, and I don't understand how but some people find a way to like me ok. It helps to talk to a lot of people. Someone will think you're cool, even if you don't get why, there is someone.",1,2017-12-04
749,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sometimes hanging out with people who are farther along in life can be a good thing. I know it sucks to see them advancing faster and becoming successful, but let that be a motivator. Maybe you're scared to ask out a hot girl/guy, that's ok, just try to talk to one. Maybe they have a job or go to a school you wish you could go to, try to find the closest thing you can to it and try it. These people you're envious of should be role models for you. If you hang out with them more often you will inevitably become at least slightly more like them. Don't give up just because you feel like you're falling behind. Good luck.",0,2017-12-04

753,ineedanewthrowawy,"If you don't mind me asking, how long did you drink and do drugs before you decided to stop? Also how long have you been clean? I've been thinking I really need to quit my bad habits but its so fucking hard when it's the only thing that dulls the pain.",2,2018-04-02
754,ineedanewthrowawy,I broke my ankle in such a way that I almost lost my foot. I couldn't walk for 8 months.,1,2018-04-11
755,ineedanewthrowawy,"Death has me so curious. Like seriously what the fuck happens to your consciousness when you die? If heaven and hell are real, then forget suicide because then you're going to hell and if the rumors hold up, thatll be even worse. What if when you die, you wake up in a pod, and your whole life has been a simulation at some arcade where only a minute of real time has passed. What if it just starts over and this time you remember all your previous experience and you have an advantage in this playthrough. That would explain why people like Arnold Schwarzenegger exist who are just amazing at everything they do. I don't know haha. Sorry to go on so long, what you said about ""the other side"" got me wondering. ",7,2018-04-11
756,ineedanewthrowawy,"I lie all the fuckin time. It's not compulsive, at least I don't think so. I just can't have my parents thinking that the reason I have a hard time doing things that seem so easy is because I just want to die. And while I'm at it, I pretend to actually care about shit when I'm talking to my friends. Not just their interests and opinions, but my own as well.",8,2018-04-11
757,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yep that's pretty much how I am too. When I first meet people they almost always like me. I'm friendly, fairly intelligent, and I can make pretty much anyone laugh. But if they hung out with me for any length of time, without a group to bring up topics, they'd see that I'm just a shell of who I was, and I fucking hate myself. I know better than to get close to people anymore.",7,2018-04-11
758,ineedanewthrowawy,"It's always getting better just very slowly, doctors are unsure whether normal sensation will return. Pain will likely always be an issue but that's ok, I'm used to it.

Wish you the best of luck with your recovery and everything else.",1,2018-04-12
759,ineedanewthrowawy,"Pretty good, I have pretty intense nerve damage but I can walk pretty normally, I just can't feel much and blood flow isn't great so I can't stand or walk for more than about 20 minutes, but it has given me an appreciation for the less impressive things in life.",2,2018-04-12
760,ineedanewthrowawy,"Hey I have friends, but I'm still lonely as shit.",2,2018-04-17
761,ineedanewthrowawy,Hey you shouldn't feel bad. I'm a guy and I've never been in a real relationship. I hate that I'm so nervous about hitting on girls and it's probably one of my biggest sources of anxiety. There are surely plenty of guys who are just scared to start the conversation with you. ,2,2018-04-24
762,ineedanewthrowawy,I wish it still made me feel that way. I dont even know why I smoke anymore. ,5,2018-04-24
763,ineedanewthrowawy,"She doesn't have sex with him because hes the kind of guy who wants to wait until hes married. She and I have actually hooked up before she met him and the only reason we haven't again is because she doesn't want to cheat on him. And believe me, it's gotten real close. She honestly handles my baggage too and I can tell her anything like no one else. Of course it's a fucked deal, but I like her anyway.",1,2018-05-27
764,ineedanewthrowawy,You were right I was a fucking idiot,1,2018-05-28
765,ineedanewthrowawy,"I appreciate the concern, but the bad things that happen to me do tend to have lasting effects. I broke my ankle so bad that I couldn't walk for 8 months and had to quit skateboarding, which was the only thing I ever loved to do. It's been wearing me down for so long and I dont know how to fix all this shit. I just cant seem to quit fucking up my life the past few years and its driving me insane. I find myself wondering whether I died in the wreck I had years ago and now I'm in hell because it's all been downhill since then.",2,2018-06-12
766,ineedanewthrowawy,"The girl I fought harder for than any other girl I've ever loved told me she didnt want to talk to me anymore and we should basically break up. Then I found out that after fucking up my car the other night, the repairs are going to be much more than expected, and much more than I can afford. On top of that, my life was just getting back to normal after a serious injury that derailed all of my plans for the future and I was just starting to feel happy for the first time in years. And now I feel worse than I ever have before. I think i might kill myself pretty soon. It's been a long time coming.",3,2018-06-12
767,ineedanewthrowawy,Hmm maybe I'm not sure I've had multiple accounts throughout the time ive used reddit. Never though anyone would recognize me,1,2018-06-14
768,ineedanewthrowawy,I agree. I dont want to think of her like this,2,2018-06-14
769,ineedanewthrowawy,"I hope you dont do it my friend. I say friend because I feel a pain similar to you and that's all it takes for me to care about a stranger on the internet. I only hope that you realize quitting isnt an answer to your problems and even though you might feel like you cant do it anymore, the fact that you've made it this long shows you have grit. You can make it if you stick it out. It wont be perfect but maybe something good will come along and in my opinion, a good thing every once in a while makes it all worth it.",1,2018-07-07
770,ineedanewthrowawy,"Hey that would be too fucking easy. When has life ever let you take the easy way out before? No choice but to keep on keeping on, at least in my experience. I dont have the balls to pull the trigger on myself. And I know that's just not the solution anyway. It's just quitting out of the game. I think depressed people are some of the toughest bastards out there even if it makes us feel weak, because of the overwhelming urge to just do nothing or quit, but most of us dont. I'll be right here with you, struggling to make this life work when it feels like it's already too late because that's the only real choice we have and were tough enough to stick it out. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk.",5,2018-07-07
771,ineedanewthrowawy,Ugh I'm in something similar. Girl says she can see us getting married one day but her boyfriend who she broke up with for me may get her back when they get back to college together. I'm like wtf I know shes just hoping he wants her back. She says she doesnt know what she wants but its fucking obvious. She just wants me to wait and see. Why the fuck would I do that? Except I bet if he doesnt want her back and she crawls back to me I'm gonna give in and be with her because I have no respect for myself. Fuck them were better off without them. It's so clear that we are. No one should settle for being a second choice and I hope you and I are both strong enough to remember that when they come back to us again. Message me if you want someone to vent to that somewhat knows how you feel. Hope you start doing better.,2,2018-07-14
772,ineedanewthrowawy,"Nah you're not wrong for feeling that at all. All I want in the world is to be close with someone and lay in bed together. Dont need sex, just someone who I love and loves me back. I had it with a girl and I miss her so dearly now that we arent cool anymore. I found another girl who wants that with me but all I can think about when I'm with her is the old girl. Even when we do get into dirty stuff I just wish I was with the other girl and it makes me feel like shit. She knows too which takes the blame somewhat off of my shoulders but I know I shouldnt put her through that. I want her back damn it. You can find someone out there if your standards are just that you want to cuddle. Girls love that shit man. Just make sure you dont do it with someone you dont love because it only helps for the moment. I dont even mean romantic love, just love. Good luck to you I know you can find someone who will cuddle with you just hide how pathetic you feel (not all of it, just the full extent) until she loves you haha as sad as that is, dont wanna scare her off.",1,2018-07-14
773,ineedanewthrowawy,"I've been lucky enough to make some friends that are good enough that they dont leave me. I'm not sure why they like me honestly because I sure as hell dont. My guess is that it's because they know I'm always gonna be there for them too. I also dont talk about my problems much but they basically force me to and even though I dont like talking about it, it does help. Just be completely yourself if you want to make true friends. I know that seems like bullshit but it seems like most people try to hide parts of themselves that they dont think are cool and sugarcoat things that they tell people. Just say fuck it and be you 100% even though you may think you're a piece of shit. People appreciate authenticity in personality more than they appreciate someone who tries to be smooth or cool. Best of luck to you I struggled for a very long time with finding myself and I still do, but I've gotten much better at it and it's only brought people closer to me when I thought it would do the opposite.",3,2018-07-14
774,ineedanewthrowawy,I've tried to make deals with god and satan even though I dont believe in either. It cant be done. The only thing left to do is learn from your mistakes and accept that they happened as much as that sucks. Everyone has regrets depressed or not and you just have to push forward even when you dont feel strong enough to do it. Theres no trick or secret to it. Just persevere when it feels impossible. It's not.,2,2018-07-14
775,ineedanewthrowawy,All the fucking time it makes me insane,1,2018-07-14
776,ineedanewthrowawy,Problem isnt that she doesnt love me back. She loves 2 people or at least says she does and I'm fucking done with it. Makes it harder though. The other girl made me realize I'm the worst kind of person there is. I tricked her into thinking I was some great guy and accepted her help with first girl and then let her hook up with me even though I knew I would never love her. Because I was lonely. I'm so incredibly ashamed of how i handled both situations. Thanks though there is some truth to what you said and I can see that. It doesnt excuse my actions with the second girl.,1,2018-07-16
777,ineedanewthrowawy,So much shit has gone down since I posted this a month ago I barely even recognize the situation but the results are the same. Basically she contacted me again and we tried being friends for a while but I know she still loves the guy who she broke up with for me and regrets what she did. She may love me but not enough to get over the other guy as I understand it. Just last night I had to tell her that I cant be friends with her and get over her at the same time. We are still on good terms but we understand that we cant be in contact for the time being. Maybe one day is right but for now I'm moving on with the confidence that it's the right choice. Thanks for your reply.,1,2018-07-17
778,ineedanewthrowawy,"Good for you my friend. Be warned though, you may not have hit the hardest part of quitting yet. I've quit for a few weeks at a time more than once. Not trying to hurt your confidence in yourself, just saying you gotta keep being strong like you are now. And yeah I recently quit smoking weed so I know exactly what you mean about the extra money! It's awesome being able to buy a game or have a night out with friends without having to be a tight wad. Best of luck to you, I'm gonna try just quitting the nicotine too but it's my weakness.",1,2018-08-25
779,ineedanewthrowawy,I have similar thoughts. But for me that only really happen when I'm trying to sleep. My dreams are fucked too. Makes me feel like a fucking mental case.,2,2018-08-28
780,ineedanewthrowawy,Yeah it's bad haha. Right on the money. Basically no emotions except the deep sadness that creeps in every once in a while. The same sadness that is now comfortable since it has  been there so long.,3,2018-08-28
781,ineedanewthrowawy,"You probably are fun to be around. If I didnt think that and I was your friend I'd probably tell you the real reason I'm friends with you. Something like how genuine you are. Just an example of a reason I hang with some not so fun people. And I dont think it's always the best course of action to try and raise your self esteem. The route I've taken is to just drop the act because i dont give a shit anymore and just be truly myself with almost everyone i meet. This has lead to me making some great friends. I still think poorly of myself, but now that I have some people who care about me I am encouraged to make them proud and my self confidence has at least improved. I hope you find your way.",2,2018-08-28

784,ineedanewthrowawy,"I hate that kind of dream. I remember a dream in which I was back with my old gf. We were just hanging out and then we we kissed and it was such a happy moment. Then I woke up. Eyes adjusted for a few seconds and I remembered that is not how things are anymore. She doesnt even live in the same city now. I go to school and work and then instead of hanging out with her, I go home by myself. ",1,2018-09-06
785,ineedanewthrowawy,"Aw shit man/woman, that's a dangerous road you're going down but I get it. I started drinking around the same age.  Now, you're going to want to keep this drinking thing up and do it almost every night because it helps you have a good time, or makes you unable to think about your problems so much. But, after a certain amount of time, it will catch up to you. You're brain will become better at handling the feeling of being drunk and the effects will start to lose their novelty. It will no longer help you the way it does now, and you will miss the way it used to make you feel, which will make you drink more heavily.  I'm not going to tell you to quit drinking because it's bad for you. I'm saying you should pump the breaks on it and try to not drink more than once every few days. The last thing you want is to build a tolerance to the medicine that makes you feel better. And with alcohol, that happens very easily and gets very expensive.",8,2018-09-06
786,ineedanewthrowawy,"Not being good at talking to the opposite gender is no excuse not to do it my friend. I was (and still am) so fucking shitty at talking to girls in early high school. It seemed like I would embarrass myself half the time I did it. The thing that got me over that fear was when one of my friends had a girlfriend and we would all hang out sometimes. This removed the pressure of trying to look good and come off as cool or whatever in front of her. And then in realized that girls are just a cuter, and usually cleaner version of guys who typically have hobbies different from my own. They laugh at the a lot of the same jokes, and appreciate a genuine person. By senior year I lost my virginity, a feat which I didnt know if I would ever accomplish. I still suck at trying to get a girl to go on a date with me but just talking? Treat her like a guy, but respect boundaries.",2,2018-09-06
787,ineedanewthrowawy,"That's rough. I never had an issue with skipping in high school because unlike yours, my mom would get super fucking pissed if I skipped. The way I've dismissed the urge to skip in college though, is to realize that I'm either going to have a shitty time at home all day (which sounds like what you do) or I'm going to have a shitty time at school and at least have something to show for it. I'm not sure that this mindset works for everyone but I hope you can try and think of it this way. Good luck.",1,2018-09-06
788,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah I feel your pain. My body is a piece of shit in general. Of course my brains fucked bc I'm depressed as hell.  I'm diabetic. Type 1 so it's not that I'm overweight, my body just doesnt work right. My ankle broke doing something that normally does not break bone, and broke so badly that I almost lost my foot. Now I have nerve damage and cant play any sports anymore. My body took skateboarding from me. The only thing that ever truly brought me joy anymore. Now here I am, no passion, no girlfriend, nothing to make it better. I claw my way through life making good grades and losing my mind at work so that I can make some money one day and at least not have that problem.",2,2018-09-06
789,ineedanewthrowawy,"Oh yeah. I know exactly where the worst part of my sadness comes from and it is literally irreversible. Hang in there. It gets a little easier over time. As far as I can tell, it is never going to go away unfortunately.",1,2018-09-06
790,ineedanewthrowawy,Tinder is a shithole haha. Been trying that for like a year now and never met anyone who I actually thought was cool.,2,2018-09-11
791,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah me too. If I'm into her? Doesnt work out, not even always bc she isnt interested, but there is always a reason. If shes into me? Odds are I dont like her that way. Just isn't meant to be I quess.",1,2018-09-11

793,ineedanewthrowawy,Yeah it does a 180 when things start going right too. Thanks though I know you're trying to help. I dont think I can be helped right now unfortunately. ,1,2018-11-12
794,ineedanewthrowawy,Always have. Why would it stop now.,1,2018-11-12
795,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah you're right thanks. I just cant stand this at the moment. I'm usually the one saying ""it always gets better"" but no. Not tonight.",1,2018-11-13
796,ineedanewthrowawy,Oh dont worry. I fucked up all my relationships at once. Nothing left to ruin.,1,2018-11-13
797,ineedanewthrowawy,I woke up to me and my ex making up and making out and I just about called in to work this morning. I want to shoot myself.,5,2018-11-16
798,ineedanewthrowawy,"Huh, well sorry to hear that. Maybe you could try hanging out with some new people or just give it a couple weeks between hanging out with them. I'm no stranger to being so down that I'm no fun to be around, so try to avoid that but I know it's not always possible. Anyway, best of luck to you, try and keep your head up.",1,2018-11-24
799,ineedanewthrowawy,I dont understand myself haha. Like why the fuck I broke up with her impulsively? I'll never forgive myself for that. God I miss her. Anyway you're right. We'll make it. Good luck.,2,2018-11-24
800,ineedanewthrowawy,I've been working so much lately to keep my mind off of my problems. Weird how differently we see it. When I'm at home alone all I can think about is the ungodly emotional pain.,1,2018-11-24
801,ineedanewthrowawy,I feel that. Everything good in my life gets taken away from me or I fuck it up. Usually I fuck it up.,33,2018-11-24
802,ineedanewthrowawy,"I'm there too bud. Only been able to think about one thing for the past 2 weeks and it makes me want to break my hand on a wall. Or worse. Hang in there with me. Itll get better eventually, even if only for a short while. I'd say it cant get any worse but I learned that was bullshit. Good luck.",6,2018-11-24
803,ineedanewthrowawy,"You should hit them up more. I sometimes felt like I was a burden when asking people to hang out, but how often are you annoyed when someone asks you to hang out? Even when I dont know them very well I'm always happy to get an invite. But yeah, I recently had a falling out with a very close friend of mine and it makes hanging out with my friend group a hard thing to do, so I feel your pain. Hang in there, ask them to hang out. No need to be anxious just ask if they want to go bowling or if you have a top golf in your area go there. If you're like I was in high school just hit them up to smoke a blunt haha. I know it seems lame but it's more fun than it sounds to do that kind of shit.",2,2018-11-24
804,ineedanewthrowawy,Sorry to hear that man. I cant imagine what that must be like. I dont know why you cant move but if I were you I'd try and find a way out. Good luck. ,1,2018-11-24
805,ineedanewthrowawy,"That's so close to what's going on with me. I told her I cant even think about other girls since her and she just asked if I was trying to make her feel guilty. No god damn it I'm a fucking mess I'm telling you about it because you're the only person I want to talk to. Anyway, I'm trying to not talk to her anymore. We'll see how long I make it this time.",6,2018-11-24
806,ineedanewthrowawy,I'm kinda there too. I'm an absolute wreck since something happened a couple weeks ago but I've only been able to cry like a few tears and I've actually tried to so I could release some stress. I literally think about it all the time too. Hardly even able to carry a conversation. I dont know how to fix it. Let me know if you find out.,2,2018-11-24
807,ineedanewthrowawy,"I wasnt with this girl long but I'm the one who fucked it up. She didnt do anything that wrong but I was going through some shit and made a mistake by ending it. Now I feel like killing myself. This is the only girl I've ever felt a connection like that with and I threw it away on impulse. Anyway, I'm going to try to tough it out. Thanks for your reply.",2,2018-11-24
808,ineedanewthrowawy,I guess the biggest thing is I dont even know if I really need to get over her yet. She says shes willing to try to patch things up (I'm the one who broke up like a fucking idiot) but shes never willing to actually meet and do it. I'm at the point where I feel like I'm being desperate asking her to meet up so I want to stop but I'm so sad about her that it's really tough. Thanks for your reply. I'm going to try and start letting go.,2,2018-11-24
809,ineedanewthrowawy,Yeah I'm fairly good at it too. It doesnt help anything. Yes I've been sad af after finally being happy for a sweet month there. So what. Good luck to you.,3,2018-11-27
810,ineedanewthrowawy,I feel that. I've been chilling with anyone who's down lately and just talking to them about themselves. When they ask me about myself it's almost always going to bring up a point of crippling sadness.,1,2018-11-27
811,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah I know I'll find someone else eventually. But she was so attractive in every way to me it was ridiculous. Her style, her music taste, her attitude towards life, she was fucked up like I am, had a great sense of humor, and of course her face and body were beautiful. I've already got a date planned for a few days from now so I'm making an effort. It's just tough because I have dreams about us making up every night. Thanks for the kind words.",2,2018-11-27
812,ineedanewthrowawy,"Idk maybe you're right. I went from spending literally every day with her to our only contact being one or two texts a day. Thanks for your advice but I cant be alone too long right now. I might do something stupid. I'd feel so uncomfortable going to one of those meetings I'll never actually do it even though I know I should. Edit: they arent that big of favors. Took someone to the dmv for example. Nothing expensive, just took time and had someone to talk to.",1,2018-11-27
813,ineedanewthrowawy,Oh fuck I'm sorry to hear that. Please dont end it. If I knew any reasons not to I'd tell them to you but I'm still trying to find them for myself. Sincerely wishing you the best of luck.,1,2018-11-27
814,ineedanewthrowawy,"I think it's weird too. I barely even enjoy it while I'm doing it but I always find myself wanting to come back to it. I've been beating back the urge to cut for over 2 years now and I think I kicked the habit for good, but I still punch the shit out of a wall on a bad day. Usually I just get absolutely wasted now and that's enough. Hope you can find a better way to deal with things. If you do, let me know.",1,2018-11-27
815,ineedanewthrowawy,I'm prett close to the same situation. I miss my ex so god damn bad. I havent met anyone new to ruin thing with yet but I'm sure I will. I've been skipping classes left and right and I'm afraid to even look at my grades. Try to hang in there with me because I cant kill myself haha. Sincerely wishing you the best of luck.,2,2018-11-27
816,ineedanewthrowawy,"God damn I'm sorry to hear that. Its turned out to be I'd say, the second shittiest year of my life as well. Wish you the best of luck.",1,2018-11-27
817,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah, gotta punch trees my friend. Your hand will be fucked but no money for repairs. Honestly feels good that it hurts me.",1,2018-11-29
818,ineedanewthrowawy,All the time. My voice is fucked.,2,2018-11-29
819,ineedanewthrowawy,"I am currently drunk off 3 tallboys right now and I can confidently say it's the reason I didnt do xanax tonight. Unless you're an alcoholic like me though, you're probably correct.",1,2018-11-29
820,ineedanewthrowawy,I can barely sleep /: if anything I get sleep deprived during these times.,1,2018-11-29
821,ineedanewthrowawy,I've been drinking so much even before we broke up. I dont even remember the last time I felt sick because of it. Its hell to go on this way.,1,2018-11-29
822,ineedanewthrowawy,Yeah I believe you're right about the drugs. They delay dealing with it rather than ridding yourself of the process. Thank you.,2,2018-11-29
823,ineedanewthrowawy,Yup. Dont want to be here but I sure as hell dont want to hurt anyone I love. Not again.,3,2018-12-01
824,ineedanewthrowawy,Yeah me too. I think about the people I would still have in my life the most. I dont think it's worth it to think about but it's not like I've found a way to stop haha. Hang in there.,15,2018-12-01
825,ineedanewthrowawy,I quit going to my therapist a couple months ago. They finally quit blowing me up about making a follow up a few days ago. Hang in there. I've been trying to talk to people about anything other than my depression for a little while.,5,2018-12-01
826,ineedanewthrowawy,I cant go far into it but I've hurt 2 people I care deeply for recently. Lost a friendship and a relationship within 2 days of each other. ,1,2018-12-02
827,ineedanewthrowawy,I get fucking wrecked most nights my friend. Doesnt matter what the next day holds. Had work today and popped pills on top of alcohol last night. It's a vicious cycle. Wish you the best.,1,2018-12-03
828,ineedanewthrowawy,I also use this sub as a sort of diary sometimes. Not wanting to cry at night? I actually wish I could at this point. Good luck out there. God (whatever the fuck that means) knows we need it.,1,2018-12-03
829,ineedanewthrowawy,I feel that. I miss someone extremely badly and someone else less so but it still pains me. I'm going to ask out a girl tomorrow. I dont have it in me to start a real relationship again yet but I'm fiending for the physical contact haha so hopefully I pull it off. Good luck out there.,8,2018-12-03
830,ineedanewthrowawy,Hahaha I wonder whod win the price of shit contest between the 2 of us. Good luck out there.,3,2018-12-03
831,ineedanewthrowawy,It's a damn shame. I'm sorry to hear that. Glad to hear she had a happy life and a loving owner though.,4,2018-12-03
832,ineedanewthrowawy,I recently picked up a second job and on top of school I am just getting wrecked. I welcome the distraction though because free time gives me time to think about the hell that I'm in.,2,2018-12-03
833,ineedanewthrowawy,I work at a department store and every song makes me feel horrible. I just got out of a relationship with a girl I still have a lot of feelings for and every single one is either sad or happy about a lover. ,3,2018-12-03
834,ineedanewthrowawy,I have dreams about the things I miss most in my life. Or just straight up fucked shit. Its hell.,1,2018-12-05
835,ineedanewthrowawy,I feel that. I've lost things that were so important to me that now I just dont know what to do anymore. Hang in there.,2,2018-12-05
836,ineedanewthrowawy,I prefer night time but if I'm not hanging out with anyone I go to a pretty dark place. Cant really stand any time of the day lately tbh.,2,2018-12-05
837,ineedanewthrowawy,"I find that just saying the things I'm thinking works just fine. I feel fucked up about something? I bring it up. Like how me and one of my best friends are not cool anymore. I was on a first date and I simply mentioned it rather than pretend it wasnt on my mind. Did I mention I cant quit thinking about my ex? Hell no. You don't have to tell people everything in order to let them in. Just give a little trust to them and to me, if they react in a way I'm ok with, it gets easier to tell them deeper things over time. Good luck out there.",40,2018-12-14
838,ineedanewthrowawy,"Like someone else said. Letting it hurt for long enough is all you can do. I got ridiculously wasted every night for a while after breaking up with my ex. I also started working A LOT so that I didnt have free time because she was all I could think about. Now that a good amount of time has passed, it doesnt hurt so much. I'm used to not having her in my life. Which sucks, but it's the only option. Now I'm talking to someone new and I still think about her. It's not as bad though. And I believe it will keep getting easier.",1,2018-12-15
839,ineedanewthrowawy,I can relate to wanting a relationship to just get to the trusting point automatically. My ex and I had that and I think I miss the relationship more than I miss her if that makes sense. We were both so broken together. I didnt feel alone when i was with her. I've never had that with anyone else. Good luck out there. Hope you find someone who you can be real with.,1,2018-12-15
840,ineedanewthrowawy,"Every time I start talking to a new girl, I get this fear. How will she feel when she finds out I'm totally fucked in my head? My ex was perfect and a disaster because of this. She was just as fucked as I was. Maybe even worse. We clicked hard, bonding and joking over the fact that we both hate our lives deeply (I know that sounds stupid edgy, whatever). Of course, not only was this part of why we were so close, it was also what tore us apart in the end. I'm finally talking to a new girl. And I'm pretty sure shes fucked as well. But that's what I relate to. So yeah. You could do what I do and find broken people to be with so they dont judge you. :)",1,2018-12-15
841,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sorry to hear that. All I can say is that I've felt that hopelessness before. Multiple times. Each time, something unexpected ends up happening (for my emotionally unhealthy ass, that means meeting a girl) and makes it better. It eventually ends, and I hit a new low point in my life. But what I'm saying, is that not seeing a light doesnt mean that there isnt some just around the corner. Even if it goes away too soon.",2,2018-12-15
842,ineedanewthrowawy,Fuck. Thanks. I had a breakup not that long ago and you reminded me that the pain really does fade with time. I already have started to feel better but I still think about her a lot. Good for you! ,3,2018-12-15
843,ineedanewthrowawy,Sorry man. I know it's tough when your friends arent there for you. Had a falling out with one of my best a month ago and I needed people so bad at that time. I'm starting to make new friends though. Hang in there. Hope things start working out for you.,3,2018-12-15
844,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sorry to hear that. The other day was a (once) very close friend of mine's birthday. I was working so I sent him a text saying happy birthday and he didnt respond. I wonder if he was doing alright. I've never had a bad bday, but I suspect this year will be my darkest. Happy birthday though. Hope things start working out for you.",1,2018-12-15
845,ineedanewthrowawy,"The biggest way I'm behind is just my school. After one semester at a University, I had a serious injury that left me unable to walk for 9 months. The rehab took another 3 so I lost a whole year. It's not too bad, but it kinda sucks being a year behind my friends who went to college at the same time as me. As for losing the girl, i actually started a second job the next day. So that was tough, but I'll be able to finally move out of my moms house, which is the other area I felt I was slow on. Good luck with your situation.",1,2018-12-16
846,ineedanewthrowawy,"I'm sorry to hear that. I was kinda in the same boat. Was back in school, had a decent job, and a beautiful girlfriend. Nothing is ever enough though haha. Cuddle your bf while it lasts and enjoy it. Because I thought I was unhappy until I lost her. Hang in there. Maybe consider going to a therapist and getting on some meds. It didnt work for me but some people say it does.",1,2018-12-16
847,ineedanewthrowawy,"I'm currently clawing my way out of the lowest point my life has ever hit. Its unfortunately about force for me. I forced myself to study a little for my finals. Forced myself to ask a girl out even though I'm not over my ex. And you know what? We actually had a good time, and that alone pulled me out of the absolute shittiest mood I've ever been in. I'm still fucked in my head but it's not quite as bad. It gave me hope that I'll find someone new to fill the void left by her. I find that I'm either going to hate my life while doing nothing productive, or hate it while getting the minimum amount of things done. So I do the latter since I dont plan on killing myself. At least that way, I dont fall behind in life any more than I already have. Hang in there, I hope you can force yourself out of the hole you're in.",2,2018-12-16
848,ineedanewthrowawy,Happy birthday my friend. I'll most likely be having a bad one this year as well.,1,2018-12-16
849,ineedanewthrowawy,"Wanting to talk to girls is something I relate to. It's weird. For me I think it's because I miss the fuck out of my relationship and talking to her every day. I dont even care about hooking up, I just prefer to talk to women about emotional things. That being said, I crave the physical ""love"" as well. So if they're into it, I welcome that too haha. Hope you find someone you can really talk to.",1,2018-12-16
850,ineedanewthrowawy,I want to cry but I never have/allow time for it. I work all the time. And when I dont I hang out with friends to distract myself. It's when I'm making the long drive to my weekend job that I get hit with that emotion. I dont want to show up to work looking like I just cried my eyes out so I dont.,2,2018-12-16
851,ineedanewthrowawy,Night times the worst for me too. I almost HAVE to hang out with people and drink so my mind doesnt dwell on dark shit.,3,2018-12-16
852,ineedanewthrowawy,"Yeah. I could barely focus on my homework for a while after a break up. It was a huge amount of effort just to get a few questions answered. It's not so bad now that I've begun to get over it but I'm glad I'm on my winter break. My other problems used to distract me too, but they're old problems now and I'm used to those being in the back of my mind. ",1,2018-12-16
853,ineedanewthrowawy,"Hey man/woman, fuck it. If shes not into you then find someone who is. I am a pretty weird guy and say fucking stupid things all the time. I still manage to somehow find girls who like me occasionally. I know its cliche but you just gotta be you. People like genuine people.",2,2018-12-20
854,ineedanewthrowawy,"But if everything is wrong and none of it is worth anything and it's all destined to go to shit, then why not take part in whatever fucked up pleasure possible? Drugs, alcohol, pussy, and laughter are the only things I work for. I'm not working towards something bigger, just coasting along. No I'm not happy, but I dont hate EVERYthing haha just a lot of things. Whatever though you can do what you do and I wish you the best. I just think that unless you die or kill yourself, you'll eventually have to start taking part in all the bullshit involved in real life. It doesnt make you a bad person to do so. You may even meet some people that change your mind about the world while doing it. I've met people who dont have any reason to be as good as they are, and they do it anyway. Just to make other people a little happier. People like that are my inspiration to keep keeping on. Imo it's not worth it to think about the problems of the world so much even though I cant escape my own.",1,2018-12-22
855,ineedanewthrowawy,"I'm just gonna say I think you've probably had a hard life and I definitely understand hating it. But you seem to be wallowing in it. What do you mean when you say ""things that are wrong"" and make you hate yourself? What does that have to do with moving out? Do you at least enjoy sex? Because that's the only damn reason I'm working my ass off to move out. I'm not saying fucking is that important but I mean c'mon. Any day I've ever gotten some (not saying it's a lot) has automatically been a fine day. That's enough reason for me to work myself half to death when so many things about life suck.",1,2018-12-22
856,ineedanewthrowawy,"The only reason I dont give up is because while it's pointless, life is literally all there is as far as I know. It's the only thing to do except die. You can quit out whenever you want but if you hadn't made mistakes and been hurt, youd probably still want to live. You only get one shot and then you're done forever. So no matter how fucked it gets, I think it's just as pointless to give up as it is to live on. Dont know if that made sense. It's hard to put into words.",3,2018-12-22
857,ineedanewthrowawy,"I feel this. I had an injury that took the only thing I cared about away from me. This was 2 years ago and I'm still a wreck. I dont care about anything now. There have been women I've cared for deeply, but no activity fills the void left by my old passion. I'm currently on my 11th day of work with no day off. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Good luck and hang in there.",2,2018-12-22
858,ineedanewthrowawy,"I went a while with no job, no school, no gf. I'm probably more depressed than I've ever been right now but I currently have 2 jobs. Here's the way I look at work with depression. Either I hate my life while doing nothing and being poor, or I hate it while working my ass off and having money. It doesnt make me happy, but at least I can afford to get fucked up most nights. Plus, I get to talk to girls at work haha.",3,2018-12-22
859,ineedanewthrowawy,What a douche. I've jumped the gun at ending relationships but never without telling the girl straight up. ,1,2018-12-22
860,ineedanewthrowawy,"Work a shit load, hang out with people a lot. Still lonely. Hang in there.",3,2018-12-22
861,ineedanewthrowawy,Feelin like a zombie out here. Hang in there.,27,2018-12-22
862,ineedanewthrowawy,"Sorry to hear that. I was doing pretty well for a while there until I went through a break up. Went back to feeling worse than ever. Right when I started a second job too. Hang in there with me. Though problems and mental instability will always be there, we'll make it through everything in time. ",2,2018-12-29
863,ineedanewthrowawy,"I think I know how you feel. I dont own a business or anything THAT high maintenance, but I'm 20, have 2 jobs, and am currently on break from school. I cant just stay at home and be dead for a few days. The only thing that's happened in months to remove some pressure is that I finally repaid my debt to my father. But now I have to continue so that I can move out. I havent had a single day off in over 2 weeks. Next week I'll have 2 days but they are going to be spent registering for classes, and looking for an apartment. It doesnt help that I have an addiction to substance abuse. Meaning I like getting fucked up, no matter the drug. Hang in there. You sound like a tough dude. I hope things settle down for you.",2,2018-12-29
864,ineedanewthrowawy,"I hate forgetting things. My friends will be talking about something that happened years ago that was so much fun and I'll ask a question. They'll reply, ""but you were there??"". And then I sort of remember it. I remember the horrible things that have happened to me so much more clearly than the good times.",3,2018-12-29
865,ineedanewthrowawy,"Talk like normal, make her laugh, and compliment her. Like if she tells me some gross guy hit on her I'll say something like, ""I feel your pain, it's tough being so ridiculously good looking isnt it?"" Idk haha good luck out there.",1,2018-12-30
866,ineedanewthrowawy,I do everything I need to do. I flirt. I hang with friends. Go to work at 2 jobs. Get decent grades when school is going on. But at the end of the day (or the beginning haha) I'm empty. It's been this way long before I even met my ex. She just made it easier to deal with. You're right though. The drinking is isnt helping. In fact its killing me. I have a problem with substances though. I dont handle being sober well. That's when the self harm creeps into my mind. Thanks for your advice. I should talk to her about it.,2,2018-12-30
867,ineedanewthrowawy,"Real sorry to hear that. I wouldnt take it as him abandoning you, but as him taking time to work on himself. I met a girl a while back and I know you weren't dating your friend but she and I quickly became close the way you describe. We weren't together long but in that time I grew to care about her more than anyone ever before. Even girls I was with for longer. I think the hardest part was getting used to not expecting a text from her at all times. The best thing you can do is accept it and try and better yourself. I know this sounds impossible right now. What I did was work my ass off all the time. I had school, and 2 jobs. I didnt have a single day off for 3 weeks at one point. I was exhausted but it helped me not constantly miss her. And it made me a lot of money. Now I can at least say that, on paper, I'm doing better than when I had her. Things like this will make you a more viable friend and maybe he will see your progress and decide he can handle a friendship with you again.",1,2019-01-10
868,ineedanewthrowawy,Haha straight whiskey or mix it with a coke so that's not happening unfortunately. But I hate the taste anyway. I just pound it till I'm gone.,1,2019-01-10
869,ineedanewthrowawy,I have 2 jobs. It helps but my hrs just got cut at one of them. And I still go out at night anyway. It did help for a while because I was working overtime right out of a break up.,1,2019-01-10
870,ineedanewthrowawy,"You're right. It's just really hard to bring it up. I've been this way for like 10 years, maybe longer. Never told anyone the real deal except when they've dragged it out of me. And I'm not friends with them anymore. So I'm overly cautious now.",1,2019-01-12
871,ineedanewthrowawy,"Not the same, but I'm helping my friend get through a break up. I personally am not over a break up at this time. I don't want to make it about me so I just barely bring it up to her.",1,2019-01-19
872,ineedanewthrowawy,I'm sorry you're going through this. I broke up with my girlfriend a while back and I still can't quit thinking about her. Just remember it gets easier. I still have bad days. In fact today is one of them. Hang in there with me. We'll get through this.,3,2019-01-26
873,ineedanewthrowawy,You can have good days when you're depressed. I've been depressed for almost 10 years. I had a great night just yesterday. I'm back to my old self today of course but I definitely have a good day every once in a while.,5,2019-01-26
874,ineedanewthrowawy,I went to a concert last night and had the best night I've had in years. It was amazing. Forgot about my ex for a little while and sang and danced and drank. This morning I woke up and for some god damn reason the first thought in my head is about her. Back to shit I guess. Enjoy that high while it lasts.,3,2019-01-26
875,ineedanewthrowawy,I mostly raw dog it. I drink hard at night though so I dont have to think for a little while. Other than that I just force myself to do everything.,2,2019-01-26

971,overwhelmed13,"Sorry to hear you’ve been feeling this way. It truly sucks. I can relate to pretty much everything you’re saying. I too started out college with some pretty strong grades, (supposed to graduate this summer), but how I’ve felt has dominated my whole approach to any work for 3 years. I also can’t/ don’t tell my parents about my state because they’re pretty strict and believe I have no reason to be depressed or filled with anxiety. 🤷🏻‍♀️

PREACH about the physical illnesses, because I find myself wishing horrible things too. You’re right, people do respond “positively” to ailments they can see &amp; witness deterioration. I call these “acceptable illnesses”. No one sees how anxiety &amp; depression fucks with someone’s head unless they want to see. 
Well done for the jump with the therapist (if I could afford one, I’d do it too!!) maybe this will help with behaviour in the long run.

As far drugs, it’s quite possible that certain drugs won’t have the same affect on each person. Some people thrive on it, some people don’t. I don’t take anything for my problems, my doctor says I’m young &amp; should try other avenues before popping pills. I’m inclined to agree but I still feel shit doc, so thanks! 
If you find you don’t feel any different with your current prescription, try a different one. I have a lecturer, whom has anxiety &amp; depression, she admitted she’s been on “cocktail of drugs” since she was 18 and she wouldn’t be where she is now if she wasn’t. Maybe you won’t need a whole caddy of drugs, but it might take a lot of trial and error before you find a mix that works for you. 

In the meantime, just stay afloat and try to stay on top of stuff (easier said than done, I am not practising what I’m preaching😳😩). Sorry if this wasn’t helpful, but if you need to talk or rant (scream), feel free to PM me! More than happy to speak to someone in the same boat as I!

993,overwhelmed13,"Hi, sorry to hear about your struggle, they sound incredibly similar to mine. Currently in college too.
My parents have hounded me for 2 years to get a job &amp; work for money obvs, but they do occasionally add that it’ll be good to go and make some friends. They also CONSISTENTLY compare me to other college students who are working/studying/parenting etc. 

And yeah that’s shit. 

I don’t feel like working because I have a lot of existing problems and I mentally cannot handle the workload/responsibility. I’m just not present. Not even for a degree I’ve been working nearly 3 years for. Sadly, my parents don’t understand this.

Shockingly 🙄, my parents aren’t sympathetic to my plight. They don’t care &amp; to them, it’s probably just a lame excuse. Every time I try to explain they just tell me to stuff a bunch of anti-depressants in my face and get on with it. If only it were that simple.

My two cents are this: if you feel like your parents are capable of understanding and supporting your choice, then tell them, bare it all and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. Maybe they’ll see how deeply this is affecting you &amp; stop. Might not be easy and sometimes parents are just stuck, so be prepared for no real reaction.

The worst that can happen is they don’t listen and continue to say it. If they still don’t understand, just block it out and leave the conversation. Show them you don’t care. My personal fav is “whatever”, really riles them up for a minute before they stop.

However, I get that technology/internet can become a facilitator in any downward spiral. I guess maybe try to limit your time on it? Sounds easier than it is, but it might do you some good. I’m always shocked when my weekly internet use comes up on my phone. So I try to proactively reduce it. I do think some aspects can be more damaging than others, for me social media is a big no-no, it makes me feel worthless against everyone else. It might be different for you.

The thing is, the more you bottle it up inside you, the worse you feel. I’ve only recently started counselling sessions &amp; it’s nice to be able to say what’s on your mind, without judgement. Maybe you should look into if your school offer that? If they feel like there is a problem, maybe they can be more lenient with school stuff (deadlines, tests and such).

As for your current situation, not sure how it works where you are, but if it’s a just a normal test (not attributing to anything hugely important) then you could try to complete it this weekend and hopefully the teacher will accept it. (My teachers in high school didn’t mind this, unless it contributed to our overall final mark for the year). 

If it is important, then you might have to come clean to your teacher and ask if you can do the unit test in front of her during the week. 

You might not be ready to divulge the details of your depression to them, so I understand this might not be what you want to do. Unfortunately since you can’t get a medical note in time without a) being diagnosed formally and b) your parent(s) present, it’s likely you might have to just rely on their compassion or just take that zero. I’m sure you can make it up some way or the other.

Yesterday night I ran out of the house. And just cried outside for an hour. I just looked at the clouds and cried because no one is listening. I cried when I tried to eat, and I cried when I went to bed. In a house full of people, no one can see me. No one hears me. Because no one actually cares?
 
Maybe I’m just being way too corny and “in my feelings”, but am I supposed to feel this way so early in my adulthood? Do I have to face everything alone??

I can relate to realising you share some traits with them, it terrifies me. I've said it on occasion to spite them but narcissistic people don't respond well.

I hope you feel better, and start taking care of yourself again. There are only a few ways we can show ourselves kindness, maybe it’s using a cleanser tonight and a moisturiser tomorrow.

Unfortunately, we can’t get that time back but it doesn’t mean our youth is over. You graduated, so congratulations! Now the world is your oyster!! Take up a hobby that interests you, or travel to some places you’ve always wanted to see. Just try and do something that makes you feel GOOD!

1163,sweetztheloli,"1 if she’s a baby then I think you can cry in front of her, Because she probably won’t remember it the next day (Only if you really need to watch her and you’re trying your hardest not to cry) 
2 if she is My age range  ( 10-13 years old)  then i’m pretty sure you can leave her alone for a minute to get yourself together (as long as you’re not in a public space) 
3 sometimes kids can pick up on your issues without you saying anything or showing any signs. We are better at reading emotions than adults. So she may already know that you’re sad (don’t take my word for it tho maybe you’re really really good at hiding it)",1,2019-03-08
1164,sweetztheloli,"OK I made a worded it weird, but what I’m trying to say is there is no good or bad person it’s just ourselves giving ourselves labels And I Kinda don’t know how describe it (because I’m 13)  and what I mean by not always having a good mental state, is sometimes we break it down sometimes we get hurt mentally, but we shouldn’t think badly about ourselves because of it, because it’s only natural to sometimes break down and take some time for yourself you can’t always be happy you can’t always be perfectly, and it’s ok you’re allowed to not always be in the right State of mind, you’re allowed to have a bad state of mental health (as long as you’re given the right type of help) because unfortunately it’s so common to be that way, that it might just be second nature to people, so yes isn’t it our nature and I think it’s ok that I got it wrong, because you pointed it out and now I can learn from it, Because I want to make people feel better in the subreddit not offended or hurt because  something I said. And I know this text is really long but I hope this is helpful :) ",1,2019-03-08

I mean she literally filmed herself complaining about the hotel I booked and paid for in front of me and rang her boyfriend up telling him how terrible it was. Kept fighting with me in the convention too and threatened to storm off. Then in a big line of people she kept telling me I smelt bad. Then she told me the guest I got my photo with was laughing at me. Then at 9am right before the convention she had something in her hand to throw at me there was screaming every single night. Never again. And even just now I heard her muttering to herself how much she hates me and how she wish she aborted me. She continues to tell me daily that she wishes I were dead. I need out of this house now. She ruined that trip and I'm ashamed to call that creature my mother. All of this stress has resulted in my hair falling out in clumps, I'm sat up at 6am currently deleting all the photos of her in my phone. I hate her and I hate my life. I want out and to never see that hag again.

1420,witchofthewoods89,"Yeah dude I don't want to be this way I don't want to keep having meltdowns but it's because I have to bottle up all the abuse that happens in this house.

1425,witchofthewoods89,My mind really does feel like it's exploding it's terrible. I tried to reach out to someone who had used me in the past sexually and he told me I was faking about the suicide thing (even though I've cut my wrists really deep before and tried to take pills before) and wanting attention and made me out to be selfish.

1451,witchofthewoods89,"They guessed I had a disease basically and injected me with dangerous drugs I didn't need for 5 days and wouldn't listen when I told them it was making me worse. The doctor told me I'd die if I didn't take them which was bullshit and then sent me off overnight close to covid patients in a ward where no one knew wtf was wrong with me after doing various blood tests. When all they had to do was send me to a skin specialist, which I asked them to do and they refused. Told me I'd have to go back to A &amp; E again after a week of suffering. And they treated not only me but all the old people there like garbage, one old lady called pearl was screaming all night and day when they came up to her. I felt awful and wanted to help they just told me she was crazy which I doubt it. It was literally a hellraiser hospital of fucked up inbred doctors/nurses. The nurse ripped my IV out and bandage off and it was so painful then mocked me for being afraid. Then she told me I was dirty for wearing my mask/hat/glasses and gloves. Told me how I was spreading more germs and how I would get sicker for doing that (yet she had no gloves or mask on herself and another doctor mocked me for wearing a mask told me i was being paranoid how they weren't wearing any). I basically told her to fuck off and refused to take it off my face. It was a nightmare.",1,2020-04-05

1456,witchofthewoods89,"Yeah total strangers on my instagram were the only ones who messaged me in hospital when I made a post. Not one family member contacted me, they still haven't and I'm home now there really is no excuse fuck all of them. My mum had shingles recently but it looks like something worse on my legs. Well the doctors had told me there was no covid 19 patients at first so that's why I agreed to stay but then an x ray man told me they were there in isolation on my ward somewhere so that was scary as fuck. I heard an old lady screaming for help all night it was horrific. Also a lot of coughing outside my hospital door, I had a mask on that they kept trying to get me to take off which was fucked up. But yeah I've had a dry cough for days now so that's fun. I'm so tired of all this. Thanks for messaging man",1,2020-04-05
1457,witchofthewoods89,Yeah after 7 years of talking online daily and meeting up in person thought I would of gotten more than that.

1458,witchofthewoods89,"Thanks for the well wishes and not really I don't believe anyone cares. That friend really upset me when I told him I might die (I wasn't even being dramatic the doctor had said this to me) his response was ""I'll miss you........I guess"" It just hurt. They told my mum she could of stayed over with me and everything but she left after 15 minutes. It just hurt and was horrible and being on an IV drip for a week when I didn't even need it has fucked my entire head up.",1,2020-04-05
1459,witchofthewoods89,"Thanks dude. I couldn't walk because of a skin disorder in my legs, it's been so scary no one knows what it is and I have to see a specialist next week.

1460,witchofthewoods89,Cheers man xxx,1,2020-04-06
1461,witchofthewoods89,"Yeah I've never been to a hospital like that, it was honestly fucked up. I only went because it was far out and hoped there would be less people there. They literally sent me home not knowing what I have and told me I'd be fine because I'm young I mean wtf. They guessed a skin disease and that was it. Risked my life there for nothing and now have had a dry cough for days :( yeah all the old people looked miserable it was so horrific my minds still disturbed.",1,2020-04-06
1462,witchofthewoods89,"Yup just to get that, he's a cold bastard. Can lay on the charm when it suits him. Thanks man, that's all I want is to survive this year.

1473,witchofthewoods89,"Yeah I keep checking the damn reports about it on reddit and everything every day. You instantly notice your mood change when you read it and it doesn't help anything other than bring your stress levels up. Been trying to watch sabrina the teenage witch because of how light hearted and fun it is. Yeah omg those dudes are your best friends online when you act all sexy on instagram but like jeez talk about mental health and you are hated. I really won't ever send nudes to him again or anyone else, just another creep I guess. Yeah I've met so many guys who pretend to care but theres a motive every time.
