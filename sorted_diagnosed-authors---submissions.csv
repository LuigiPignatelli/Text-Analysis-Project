50,Ap-a-live,0,Sometimes I feel I have the destiny of a philosopher/writer in the nineteenth century. I keep trying to find a solution for my problems. But even though I am in therapy I can‘t find it. Sometimes I therefore think it is my destiny to have a life full of suffering but also full of thining about life instead of living it. Anyone relate?,6/12/2018
51,Ap-a-live,8,"Hi everybody, I am new in this sub and I hope that some of you can have some answers for me. I am diagnosed, amongst others, with depression and I also go to therapy. Therapy helps but many times I do not get the practical advise I need. So here I am hoping that some of you will share their experiences with me. I experience my emotions very strongly. Apart from sadness and hopelessness, I mostly struggle with lots of anger. As soon as a problem shows up in my life; for instance I don't feel taken seriousely by my therapist or I get treated badly by somebody, I get so so so angry. And I have no way of dealing with the anger. Mostly the anger is directed at what went wrong, but also many times I am angry at the whole world. And sometimes I get very angry at people close to me. So If something went wrong in my life and a famliy member would additionally spill some coffee in the kitchen, that is when it gets really bad. So I would really like to work on that because I don't want to be nasty to people around me and I always feel so sorry for it.",8/8/2018
53,Ap-a-live,0,"For a long time I suffer from anxiety and ocd but the underlying cause isn‘t clear. Theory says that there is many reasons why I‘m just scared of everything, including depression. I wonder if anyone has ever made this connection with his or her case.",5/22/2019

55,Ap-a-live,5,"I am not sure what to expect from this post. I think maybe it is just a vent because I am so incredibly sad. Three years ago I got very ill. Things started to get bad at work and also I got difficulties in my friendships. I couldn‘t be relaxed around my friends anymore because the pressure of the illness made it all so difficult for me. So when only a tiny problem would show up in a friendship I couldn‘t deal with it anymore in a reasonable way. So what I did because of that is that I cut contact to all of my friends, just because it got too much. Now three years later, I am on the way to recovery, but now I am more alone than ever. No birthday invites, no weddings to attend to, no nights out, nothing. I am living the life of an old person, but I am only in my early thirties. How can I ever make this undone? I miss my friends, I miss having somewhere to belong, especially because at my age it is so much more difficult to make friends.",7/17/2019
57,Ap-a-live,4,I had to go through stuff the last few years that can break a person. I have been through so much shit thanks to my old employer that I don’t know how to ever get over it. I have been let down in the most evil way possible. How am I supposed to trust again? How long will it take until I can forget about what has happened? I am pretty much in desolation and I just can’t get over it.,4/1/2020
58,Ap-a-live,3,"I just got fired from a toxic job. I have been in it for 9 months and from the beginning I got pushed around by a work collegue. Now it turns out that he has so much influence that I was let go. It is strange because four months ago my boss was fired from the same accusation. The boss and the boss of my boss I have only seen maybe three times each in person (because of covid but also because my direct new boss only works a day a week; and the boss of my boss never was interested in knowing me). They don‘t really know me and the first time they asked me for my side of the story was today, just a minute before firing me.
I am hurt by the way they listed all my mistakes and basically told me what a unworthy person I am. Because while I know I have made mistakes I also know that most of the accusations are not true. But I have no proof.

At first I felt actually very relieved that this horror in my life ends. However I start to feel very awful, I analyze in my head all the situations that have happened in the last nine months and I ask myself how it was possible to become like this. I don‘t really know how to deal with this. Also obviousely I am very worried about getting a good reference and finding a new job.",4/1/2021
87,Burneracct1270,0,"First post using a burner account due to personal info,

I feel like I’m drowning in a pool of guilt of pleasing everyone around me with their hopes of what I can achieve. I know I can achieve them it’s just I don’t feel like any thought I have is my own recently. Nothing I used to be happy doing makes me happy. I just want it to end. School is becoming increasingly stressful, failed most of my classes this semester. 

Failing the semester was the only reason I told anyone about how I’ve been feeling. Told my parents and they are treating me different forcing me to eat, trying to get me out of the house, being increasingly caring and nice to me. I understand they are genuinely concerned, but it makes me feel more guilty for even existing. I feel like I am a burden to everyone (siblings,parents,what’s left of friend group). I never feel fulfilled with myself. I feel as if I’m alive for other people

I wish I was never born. Maybe everyone’s life would be easier. I don’t want to kill myself because I would feel guilty for hurting the people who care about. I don’t know if my mom could recover from her child committing suicide. I don’t have any dreams. My laughs and jokes are for everyone else not myself. 

I haven’t felt happy with myself for a long time and it’s exhausting. I feel unhealthy. I’m losing weight very fast. I am never hungry. I throw up when I try to eat a good meal. 

I feel trapped and like I can barely breathe. Want this to all just end",5/16/2019
88,Burneracct1270,3,"I’ve been feeling depressed for this whole semester. I recently opened up to family about my mental health and suicidal thoughts. I never told them I am self harming. My family is trying to control my life for me and I understand they are trying to do these things to help me. Like my family will force me to go shopping with them, go see friends, etc. I never feel fulfilled unless I’m high or asleep. They force me to eat when a lot of times I throw it up. I understand they want to help me but I feel like every decision is theirs and not mine. I’ve lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. Photography isn’t fun for me anymore. I was always happy taking pictures because I felt like I had control over what people saw because they saw something from my perspective. Now I feel like I don’t even have that. I haven’t touched my camera in months. I’ve lost most of my friends. My grades were bad this semester putting me on academic probation. I understand my family does all these things to try to help me boost my self worth, but I want to do stuff for myself, as selfish as it sounds. I feel like I have no control. I feel like my body and mind are in neutral and the people around me have control over me.",5/18/2019
89,Burneracct1270,0,"I recently told my family about my depression. I only told them because I failed a semester in college. They have been super passive aggressive saying I need to change my view on the world which is a lot easier said than done. Today my family member ran into my room and woke me up from a nap and yelled at me saying I need to live like a human and not sleep my days away like a zombie. This is making me feel worse and I feel like I’m digging myself into a hole. I just want to die to end their stresses about me. Telling them was both helpful and un-helpful because how they are reacting. When they are frustrated in the way I am acting or feeling, they yell and make me feel worse. Just want it all to end",5/18/2019
90,Burneracct1270,4,"Had a talk with someone in my family about my depression today. Went horrible. I am really bad at articulating my emotions and feeling. I just bottle them up. So talking to family about how I’m feeling is something I can’t really get myself to do. The talk turned into a lecture about how my depressive self-destructive behavior is not only making my life harder but my families. Was told I “wasn’t really depressed” and how I have a lack of discipline in my life. Out loud I didn’t say anything. Just listened until they got tired of talking. Then went to my room feeling worse and self harmed myself. I’m sorry my feelings are a burden upon you and the rest of the family. I’m sorry I don’t feel happy or motivated to wake up. I’m sorry I don’t want to eat food anymore. I’m sorry I’m suicidal. I’m sorry I feel like everything would be better if I didn’t exist. I’m sorry I’m tired of living. I’m tired of being tired. Do you think I want to fail an entire semester of college, lose all my friends, think about dying every minute, and want to just end it all? I’m sorry if me not wanting to be alive makes you more stressed. I regret opening up to anyone about my depression.",5/27/2019
91,Burneracct1270,2,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have started taking paroxetine 10mg one pill daily. I’ve been on the medication for 3 days now and I am feeling more depressed. I self harmed today which felt really good even though I regret it. I’ve been feeling more irritable and angry. I’ve been emotional, example being last night my mom cut me some fruit to eat and I didn’t want it and I just yelled at her and started crying and started feeling emotional for no reason. Granted they have been trying to get me to eat because I am refusing food and losing a lot of weight. Has anyone else had these sort of side effects? If so did they go away? Or should I just talk to my doctor and try to switch for a different medication?",5/27/2019
92,Burneracct1270,2,"Wrote a poem (an attempt) tonight about how I’m feeling right now 

Candle
Feeling pliable and inanimate 
Like a wax figure in a dark room
Illusory but looks akin to it
Probing for the light
Searching for the wick 
To spark and illuminate 
Just to melt away
As the light fades
So does this figure 
What a relief that would be",5/29/2019

104,CubistIvy,1,"I’ve had issues with depression since I was 15. I’m 20 now and I can’t really put my finger on how I feel. 
Two years ago my father died which resulted in me having to be a rock for my mother despite not really coping with it myself. As a result of my grief, months later I went overseas and married my boyfriend. Nothing dramatic, just two people signing some papers at a court house. For the last two years he’s told me that he never wanted it, that he’s not ready and that it was a huge mistake that I forced him into. We’ve been on the verge of divorce for the past few months. 
I’m in the middle of my law degree and feel like a complete failure at it. I’m passing my classes and everything but it just doesn’t feel like I’m accomplishing anything. 
Last week I was sexually assaulted/almost raped and I’ve been a whirlwind of emotions since. I’m so angry and hurt and just sad at the same time. 
I’ve been on and off of medication and nothing seems to work. Often at night I get so hysterically sad, I don’t know what to do with myself other than self harm. I’m in a long term relationship and I have a few friends but I don’t feel like anybody really cares. My boyfriend least of all. I’ve tried talking to them but no one is really interested. 
I don’t exactly want to die, I wouldn’t mind if I did, but I just want it all to stop. I want to wake up in the morning and feel okay and actually look forward to the day and go to sleep without being consumed my anxiety. I don’t know what to fill my days with anymore, so all I do is think. ",10/22/2017
105,CubistIvy,1,"Whenever I’m about to go to sleep my mind focuses on every terrible thing in my life. I feel fine during the day, but then when I close my eyes at night my brain is just flooded with an overwhelming feel of failure, self harm urges and just a panic-y anxiety that is so overwhelming that I struggle breathing. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Any tips are so appreciated. ",1/7/2018
106,CubistIvy,11,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 16. I’m 21 now. For the last few years there have been patches where it has come back for periods of time but recently I’ve been hit with a wave that just won’t seem to go away and it’s gotten to the point where I have really strong urges to self harm, mostly at night. 

The depression and anxiety seems to be a constant thing but gets worse when it’s triggered by something. These days it seems like anything and everything is a trigger, from a song to the sun shining or a place. I can’t figure out what it is but I’m tired of feeling so bad all the time. 

The desire to self harm comes mostly when I’m at my lowest. I guess as a way to release all the things I’m feeling. I usually try to distract myself with a game on my phone or a tv show but those things aren’t really working anymore. 

I guess I’m wondering if anyone has any tips other than ‘go outside and be around people’ to get past this low point or how to get rid of the urges?",5/29/2018
107,CubistIvy,9,Preferably something not scary ,5/31/2018
108,CubistIvy,30,It feels like all of my feelings are constantly heightened. Everything I feel is so intense to the point that it’s overwhelming. Especially sadness. The bad things in my personal life and in the world in general weigh so heavily on me that I feel like they consume me. It also feels like I notice and remember things more than the people around my. It seems like I can pick up on people’s feelings and small differences in their behaviour without any effort. Sometimes it just feels like I’m over sensitive. Anyone else? ,5/31/2018
109,CubistIvy,1,My boyfriend invited his two friends who played a part in him almost cheating on me over to watch the World Cup with us. I thought I would be okay to be around them but I’m so uncomfortable and it brought up so many emotions and memories and I left as soon as I felt the panic attack coming on but now I can’t control it and I feel so bad. ,6/21/2018
110,CubistIvy,7,"Nothing in my life is wrong but I’ve fallen back down a dark hole that I can’t get out of. Before a few days ago I hadn’t self harmed in almost 6 years except once, very lightly. Now I can’t stop and I don’t want to. It seems like it’s the solution to everything and as soon as I’m alone it’s all I can think about. When I go to bed at night all I can think about is how much I want to die. I unsuccessfully attempted to suicide 3 times between 15 and 17. I’m 21 now and I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want my actions to hurt anybody but at the same time I don’t think anybody’s life would really be impacted by my absence anyway. I’m so scared of being alone. ",6/24/2018
111,CubistIvy,1,"I tried to kill myself 3 times when I was 16 and when I failed all people told me is that it would get better and that I wouldn’t feel like this forever. And it got better for a while. But I’m almost 22 and I wish I had succeeded back then. I don’t want to live, nothing makes sense and I’m too much of a coward to kill myself now. ",7/23/2018
112,CubistIvy,2,"It’s my dads birthday tomorrow. He died 3 years ago and was in hospital for 3 months before that. I miss him so much and I feel awful about how our relationship was before he died. 

He came into my life when I was 5. I’m 21 now. When things got serious between my mother and him she kind of forced me to call him ‘dad’. I didn’t understand why and I resented him for it. But he was always an amazing father figure to me. I never knew my biological father so he naturally kind of just took that place. We had a good relationship. 

When he died my mother told me about my biological father and why things happened the way they did. It gave me a lot of closure and helped open my heart up to my ‘dad’. But he’s gone and I’m so angry that I never got to have this time with him. I’ve matured so much since he died and it makes me so sad that the only time I got with him was during the bratty teenage years and before then I was too young to really remember much. 

I’m angry at him for leaving my mom and I. I’m angry that I didn’t see it coming and never got to say goodbye. I’m angry that I miss him so much and I can’t talk to him and it’s been 3 years already. 

Does it ever get easier? ",8/27/2018
113,CubistIvy,3,"For the last few years every night without fail before I fall asleep I think about dying or killing myself. I’ll play out every detail, planning it, doing it and watching my life after I’m gone. In a way I think it comforts me. 

Sometimes it feels like no matter how happy or sad I am, I still wish I could just die. Almost 6 years ago I tried to kill myself multiple times, I think I’ve established now that I’m just not brave enough to cut deep enough or take enough pills so maybe fantasising about it is the next best thing? 

I don’t know. Is this normal? Do adults who were suicidal teenagers do this stuff? ",8/30/2018
114,CubistIvy,7,"I overthink and worry about everything to the point where I create scenarios in my head that are so far from reality, but I can’t stop and it spirals to the point where I convince myself it’s the truth.

115,CubistIvy,5,"It seems like ever since I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and BPD my partner just hasn’t been able to love me? It feels like he’s given up trying to care about me or how I’m feeling or show any kind of emotion towards me at all. Like when I’m down these days he just shrugs it off or ignores it. 

I try my best to keep it away from him, I think I do a pretty good job most of the time. I guess sometimes the sadness or irrational worry comes through. 

Has this happened to anybody else? I’ve really been trying to better myself, I’ve been going to therapy and really doing my best but I can’t help but feel like a burden. ",9/4/2018
116,CubistIvy,5,"Everybody talks about wanting to support loved ones with depression or anxiety or bipolar etc but in reality mentally ill people get categorised with negativity and toxicity and just drown in their issues because the people who claim to love them don’t want to deal with it. 

I’m really struggling to cope with the ‘bad days’. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve made so much progress and most of my days are good or at least okay, but every now and then I’ll have a bad one and I feel completely alone when it happens. 

I have a great family, friends, boyfriend who claim they want to support me but when it comes down to it, they don’t. I don’t ask for much, maybe a little understanding, just for whoever is around me to be a little kinder, more understanding but it seems like their mind set is just ‘oh you’re having an off day? I don’t want to deal with you’. 

I’m enjoy my own company and have always dealt with everything on my own, and I’m good at it, but sometimes I just need a little support, especially when people claim they care. I’ve on many occasions been told I just need to deal with it by myself and get over it. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences? Advice? ",9/26/2018
117,CubistIvy,4,"Whenever my (21/f) boyfriend (24/m) and I have an argument he ends it by telling me that I’m ‘not perfect’. It’ll be something like me telling him that I wish he wouldn’t text while we’re having a date night dinner and he’ll go on about how I think I’m so amazing but I’m not perfect and I make all these mistakes as well etc. 

I’ve never said that I’m perfect, I’m well aware that there are thing that I do wrong and insecurities I have, but I just don’t voice them to him. I try to be as independent and confident as possible but I struggle with depression and when he says these things it makes me feel awful even though I know I’m not perfect. 

It seems like this is his response to anything I say. Sometimes it feels like he just wants to put me down. Does anyone have any insight on why he might do this or what it means? I’m lost. ",9/29/2018
118,CubistIvy,0,"In the last few years I’ve lost almost every close friend I’ve never had and I don’t understand. I don’t talk about my mental health with them, so I don’t think that’s it. None of these friendships have faded away, they’ve all abruptly ended. 

My best friend since I was 15 (I’m 21 now) recently told me he doesn’t want to be friends anymore because we don’t talk enough. We would text every day but sometimes I would need a mental health day or I’d be busy with uni or work and I just wouldn’t have the time to message him, and he’d immediately get upset if even one day passed without us texting to the point where he eventually messaged me and then blocked me. 

The same thing has happened with 4 other friends. I don’t understand. I want to have relationships with people who understand that we all have lives and are busy sometimes but that doesn’t mean we aren’t friends. I’ve constantly been there and supported all of these friend. 

Is this what friendships are usually like? I just feel lost. ",10/9/2018

With that my step brother who I also spent my whole life around decided we weren’t family anymore. So now it’s just me and my mom and it’s awful. I miss my dad and every conversation I have with my mom is just an argument. 

I thought things with my boyfriend of 4 years were getting better but he’s fine with making me feel like I force him to spend time with me and everything is my fault. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go. I just feel alone and as much as it sucks to admit it, the temptation to self harm is overwhelming. I’ve been clean for a few months now but I don’t think I can do it anymore.

121,CubistIvy,11,"Im not looking for advice or sympathy, I just need to tell someone because I can’t take it anymore. I know I’m very privileged and there’s so many people who have it worse than I do yet I still just want to disappear. 

Nothing in my life is okay. I lost my dad 3 years ago and now I spend every day worrying about whether my mom is okay and what I can do to make it all bearable whilst missing him like crazy. I hate myself every day because I spent the last 6 months of his life with my boyfriend because I thought he would be okay and it was a new relationship. Even worse, I didn’t even visit him in hospital on his last night. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. After the first year it’s always been bumpy but I love him. 6 months ago I found girls numbers in his phone, condoms in his car and he told me it was just in case he wanted to sleep with someone else. I forgave him and tried to move on as he said he wasn’t that guy and he’s been great ever since but I just can’t move past it and it’s killing me. I know his life would be much happier without me in it, he’s just too weak to leave. 

Something goes wrong with every friendship I make, or they move away, or we just don’t connect. I’m doing a university course I was so passionate about when I went into it and now I can’t even find the motivation to go to class. 

It’s Christmas Day and I’m alone and nobody even notices. I just want to die. I was ready to take the pills and the alcohol and then my dog jumped on my bed and now I’m too weak to do it. I hate myself. ",12/25/2018
122,CubistIvy,3,"When I was 15 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. At 16 I attempted suicide for the first time, and two more times between then and my 17th birthday. I’m 22 now and since then I’ve been okay, there’s been a bit of self harm but now I’m clean 4 months. But now I suddenly don’t know how to cope anymore. My dad died 3 years ago and that’s a huge trigger for me, especially around the holidays but I didn’t think it would get this bad. 

I work out almost every day, I have a good diet, I’m outdoors a lot, I only have a few close friends but they are good ones. But I just don’t want to live anymore. I came very close to trying again last night and I think I would have gone through with it if my dog hadn’t jumped on my bed. I had the pills counted out and the alcohol ready. And that scares me because I thought I forgot this feeling. I called lifeline and they told me all about how it gets better and all that but I’ve felt like this for 7 years. Sure, there’s been some good moments. Weeks, maybe even months where I haven’t thought about dying or stepping in front of a train or hurting myself but in the end it all just circles back to this. I see a therapist every week but it feels like everyone’s just telling me that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and it just doesn’t feel like it. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I’ve been sleeping on my friends couch because I’m so scared of what will happen if I’m alone at night but I can’t talk to him about this. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend but he’s made it clear that he doesn’t care. Is fear and a dog a good enough reason to stay alive? I don’t want to feel like this anymore.

He guessed it after asking me why I was acting weird the following day, his response was ‘stop acting like you’re all alone’. I expressed to him that I didn’t feel like life was worth it for me anymore because it always comes back to this no matter how good things are momentarily. I was a mess that night, the worst I’ve felt in years and considered Suicide multiple times. It was very obvious that I was struggling. 

The following morning he had to leave for his place for a few days. I received the usual ‘love you’ and ‘get up to anything interesting today’ texts but nothing beyond that. It’s been 2 days and I guess I just thought I’d receive a little more support and reassurance that he’s there for me. I told him that and his response was ‘well yeah I was busy.’

Am I overreacting? I’m feeling a little better now, having spoken with my therapist and a close friend who’s been very supportive. P",10/18/2020

Well a lot went wrong today, it's finals season at my school after all. And wouldn't you know it, I have a job interview tomorrow.

I'm typing this up because even though the interview is at 10 tomorrow I'm not sure if I'll be able to fall asleep. And I'm curious.

I can't die. I can't stand the thought of my roommates discovering my body and watching as the medical team carries my limp body out of our dorm. I can't leave my parents stuck with the bill for college. I can't stand the thought of my niece and nephews looking at me in a casket, cold and lifeless.

They're very busy right now as they just reopened after the Corona virus shutdowns so they couldn't get me in until June 5th. Around 2 or 3 weeks after I called them. Now I found out my family is taking a vacation this week (the same week as my appointment) and want me to come. Our schools quarter just ended Thursday and I just moved into a new apartment Friday so I probably won't even be unpacked until at least Tuesday. Then my appointment is Friday.

Should I even try to go on the vacation. I think my mother would be upset if I don't because they never get to see me anymore. I only live 4 hours away, but it's still quite a distance when myself and everyone else in the family is always busy. Then to get where they are going for vacation for me it would be about a 6 hour drive in an old car with a broken AC in Georgia. Driving 12 hours in three days doesn't seem worth it to me. 

I think the only way I'd be able to go would be to cancel my appointment. But, who knows when they would be able to schedule me for another appointment. I think they said the next available slot for my therapist would be at the end of June. By that time Summer quarter will have started and I won't have as much free time so I'd be limited on what time I could set an appointment as well.

It probably doesn't help that our school just stated that next quarter is going to be all online classes too, this extreme lack of socialization is actually numbing too me.

158,DonRawiri,3,"I have severe depression and anxiety for the past 31 years, I'm currently 37.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to therapy on and off since I was 6, sometimes willingly other times not so much.  A quick recap until two years ago when I started going to a psychiatrist. Sexually molested from 6 to 9 years old by my older brother, I keep it to myself because of threat of dead and I had to protect my younger brother. Exposed everything when my younger brother was abused. Fast forward 11 years till I'm 20 and basically just waiting to die when I went to therapy for a year and was helping a lot, when suddenly my father died so I just focused on partying for a bit and then work and helping out.

&amp;#x200B;

A year ago my body gave out, pain all over and my mind was all over the place, so I started seeking help again, I have been to several doctors and heavily medicated since January. A couple of weeks ago the psychiatrist changed my meds because they were not working and had an EEG where they found that when I'm anxious the voltage of the cortex of my left side of the brain is off and gives me a tendency to apathy.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after all that. I'm really tired of all the effort, sacrifices and struggles with every aspect of my life: family, friends, work and even myself. So far I've been keeping doing the right thing, seeking help, talking to my loved ones, finding new hobbies or a job that I could enjoy, talking to people in similar situations like me, I even talked to my wife into letting me sleep with other woman (tried it once), nothing seems to work and it's the same struggle every day just to get out of bed. I just don't know what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing settled yet but I'm thinking to take a trip in a few weeks to an exotic place, indulge and try to enjoy myself  for a month or so in one last attempt to find something worth it in this life.

From the first appointment I told the doc that I wanted to leave my wife because when I see her or I’m with her I don’t feel anything anymore and I don’t want to hurt her. If anything at all she gives me more anxiety. I do have a couple of friends whom I like and enjoy their company very much.

I started medication immediately and was told to not make any major decisions or life changes. After 4 months the meds were not working and they recently changed them but I still feel nothing for my wife and feel more depressed than ever because nothing is working.

And big surprise I’ve done stuff that ends up hurting my wife, a couple of moths ago I finally moved to the guest bedroom with all my stuff, and after a few talks we are basically just friends. I can do anything I want as long as it’s helpful for me.

So today I’m going out with my wife to a small celebration for the 5 year wedding anniversary and tomorrow I have plans with a friend that might end up with me spending the night with her (for the second time).

I'm moving from psychotherapy to a therapy based on emotions.

Psychotherapy helped a lot, started going 1.5 years ago, it got me out of bed, it got me out of being suicidal, and helped me to process some old traumas rationally.

201,FiatLux831,1,"I was on a phone call with this friend a few hours ago and she admitted to me that she made an account on Reddit to post to suicide watch. For some reason I thought nobody irl used Reddit but me, so it caught me off guard. We’ve both been diagnosed with depression so it’s not that far of a reach. 

Anyway, we shared with each other how we barely got any replies to our own posts and how our medications are going. After the call ended I was quite curious to see the post she posted and what she said in it. I did a little research and found her account. 

I was a bit sad to read her post. Naturally because nobody wants a friend to read how down you’re feeling but more about what she said in the post. In it she stated that she thinks nobody believes she’s truly depressed/suicidal because of me. The reasons being are because I was diagnosed first, ended up in a psychiatric hospital, had multiple seizures from my medication, doctors found a tumor in my brain, and I could go on and on. In her eyes I have it “worse” than her. And for that reason she believes her depression isn’t as valid. Almost as if she believes people will think “Why are you sad? FiatLux831 has been through worse, you’re just following along for attention.” Which is something she herself was worried about in her original post. 

She doesn’t know I’ve read the post. Do I ask her about it? I just don’t want her to think people don’t pay attention to her wellbeing just because I’ve had really bad experiences that she herself hasn’t gone through. The last thing I want is for her to experience what I’ve been through either.

202,FiatLux831,2,"Basically after graduating high school everyone of my friends went to different schools. During the fall quarter I was diagnosed with depression and it was really bad. Ended up going to a psychiatric hospital involuntary, medication, you get it.

About 1 month later a close girl friend of mine called and told me she too felt depressed and went to seek help. She attempted suicide shortly after but thankfully it didn’t work. She’s currently on the same medication I was on. Now, I’ve heard from a different friend at a nearby college that another one of my best friends from high school is also going to therapy and might start antidepressants too. Keep in mind I’ve known all of these people for over 4 years. So of course I feel worried. 

This seems so crazy to me. I never thought college would turn out this way for all of us. I guess the teachers never told us to expect things like these. Has anyone ever had similar experiences? Is it “normal” for a close group of fiends to go through depression at the same time? ",3/10/2019

I remember when I was around 14 and cutting oneself was seen as “trendy” or cool in middle school. At least that’s what I thought it looked liked. I had a friend who would sit next to me in class and she had really deep cuts. I mean they were big scars. I remember being a little disgusted and to this day I regret being so judgmental over her. I never said anything about it to her and we did get along but that was something I didn’t understand. I guess I was curious as to what the big deal was back then so one day I tried it myself and it hurt like a bitch. It looked like a cat scratch and that was enough for me to realize I didn’t like it nor did I understand it.  I had read about this “feel good” feeling thing that was supposed to happen but it was a definite no for me.

But I don’t even recognize who I was during that moment. I was laughing a little and smiling during the act? I literally felt crazy. But there’s a part of me that wants to do it again.

And it has nothing to do with me wanting attention. Because I know some people might see it that way. Hardly anyone I know knows I’m depressed actually.

I don’t fully understand it but I just thought i would share Incase anyone else also feels this way. I guess it’s almost like self harm in a way. I’m not physically being hurt by my actions, but I’m choosing to hurt myself by letting myself go untreated. And I know it 😕",7/28/2019
207,FiatLux831,3,For people who have taken this medication for anxiety does it actually help you? I was prescribed the 1mg tablet and taken it twice. I just felt dizzy and that’s about it. For me it takes around 50 minutes to kick in. My vision turned a little blurry as well. Is it supposed to do something else? I feel like I shouldn’t even bother taking it if all it’s doing is making me feel disoriented.,8/31/2019
218,Ganjanthegr33n,0,"Thats just a fact i feel like. Im not complaining, i know im not particulary ugly and its not like girls would instinctivly distance themselves from me, its just that i suck at relationships of any kind. I csnt even really maintain a real friendship that aint based on drinking or smoking weed. i moved around alot as a kid so i feel like thats something i never really learned, i kinda got ignored alot of times i tried to fit in in a new class or something.  It got better for a while where i thought i had overcome my anxiety, but as soon as school ended 2 years later i never saw most of my ""friends"" again. Its only now that i realised that the drinking and smoking guy i am now really isnt who i always was. I always was kind of a nerd, who spent his time in his room drawing, playing guitar, teaching him self to code, or doing sport like skating, mountain biking, etc... Its just that i never went through with something. And Its not like im completely back to my old self, its weird and kinda depressing to make that transition to your old, lonely life, but i think its better that way. I do still have a few good friends, and my anxiety has gotten wayyyy better, simply because ive been working for the past year and ive practicly beeing forced to talk to new people every day. And i love my current job, i actually enjoy going to work more than coming home. Its just, i dont enjoy meeting new people. I went from beeing afraid, to simply not caring. I dont care for other peoples company, just ""hanging out"" is such an alien concept for me. I dont care for other peoples empathy, i just wanna be left alone. I dont care if i havent met my friends in weeks, i know ill see them at the same party anyway next week. Thats enough for me to keep a relationship alive. I dont care if iever get a girlfriend, iknow its not just gonna happen, and i dont care enough to actually put in any effort. I dont know a single girl that interests me in the slightest, though i really dont meet new people at all anyways. 
Im not beating myself up about this, im not saying i aint good enough, im pretty sure there where a hand full of girls who actually where interested in me, i just screwed up every time. And looking at every single relationship i have witnessed in my enviorment, its just not fucking worth it in my eyes. My best friends where suddenly gone, each day you hear about how they keeping arguing about trivial shit, and all that so they can stick it in every time they meet. Like its just not fucking worth it.  I decided thats not what im gonna do with my life, that i do t want to make drugs, parties and women the center of my universe the way i feel everybody else does. My dream is to study music, i even decided im gonna take guitar lessons again. As soon as i have a tutor, ill stop smoking weed with one day a month beeing the exception, so that it wont interfere with my learning process. I have another 3 years to get ready for the entrie exams,  im gonna (ihave no idea what the english word for the time you are training s professionis) train to be a sound technician and practice my guitar playing in my free time. Im not a beginner, so i do think 3 years are a fairly realistic goal. If im not accepted, at least i didnt waste my time and have a job afterwards, and ill still be able to work in the music buisiness.  All in all my life is going pretty well. Im not gonna say my depression is gone, time has proven me how easy it can and will happen again, but im fine with where i am right now. Im just not sharing my life with anyone, and i dont think i ever really will. Im not the type to seek company, even when i want to. But its better this way. Im spending my time more wisely and am more self aware, and for rhe furst time in a while i have ambitions and amready to suffer if nececary. I think thats a huge step for me. 

I know this is all over the place, been writing this on mobile for the past few hours whenever u got a few spare minutes at work. This doesnt really have a point, i was just bored and felt like sharing my life with people who will have no influence on me or my decisions. Thx for reading if you got this far. ",1/18/2019

Turns out that wasnt true, however during that time ive been told alot of times how much fun i was, how its so easy to talk to me, for hours, how i was quite charismatic basically. 

I have a huge confidence problem, i know i can be very calm and professional on a surface level, but mostly i feel like an awkward piece of shit who just keeps his distance to everyone. On days like today however, its the complete opposite. I feel alert, outgoing, enjoy the people at work and just feel great. I often imagine a conversation and watch myself inthe mirror, to get abetter picture of myself and how i couldbe viewed by others. and tbh wheni look at me like that, i feel like a different person.

223,Ganjanthegr33n,0,"It sounds weird, but i think that only in the last year have i started understanding and accepting that i am actually depressed. In middleschool ive been diagnosed with depression, however i never really understood what that meant. I never really got what was wrong with me, why i went to therapy, what they where actually trying to accomplish by talking to some person an hour every week. I knew i had these depressive episodes, lying in bed, feeling like the most worthless piece of shit on earth, however i always ignored them. You cry yourself to sleep, and the next day you wake up and pretend like it didnt happen, cuz suddenly it didnt make sense anymore that i felt that way. It was pathetic. In highschool everything seemed to suddenly get better when i finally found friends, went to parties at the weekends, i thought i have finally made it, and repressed those middleschool years.  Everything went great for two years, then i had to repeat a year, and realised that none of those people where actual friends, that once im not forced to see them every day at school anymore, most of them where just gone. I started smoking weed that year, cuz when i was high that stuff didnt matter, i was happy with myself. At least for a while, until i realised that weed and alcohol are everything i got, that theres nothing else that makes me happy, and that all of my social contacts are based on drugs. 

Now im done with highschool for a whole year, and ive realised that im not a healthy person. That i hate myself, that im lonely, and always have been. That those highschool years where only a break from the isolation that defined my whole school life. We moved alot, so i always had a real hard time finding friends, and i barely have any people i know longer than 3 or 4 years. I always was very lonely for almost as long as i can remember, i just pretended like those times didnt happen. I have just lately realised that there where times in middleschool where i was actually making plans to kill myself, and i believed id go through with them. I never was someone to take myself very seriously, but holy fuck. 
Depression is when you hate who you are. When you feel like an asshole cuz you are very defensive and suspicious of everyone, even your friends, when you always think people are using you and beeing selfish, so in return you dont get atached to people and start using them. When you believe that everyone and everything can get better, just not you. Cuz youre broken and cant ve fixed. You cant be loved, cuz you dont love yourself. When you dont tell people about your feelings cuz you know you sound whiny and ungratefull.

255,GrumpyPanda13,1,"Hi all,
Some background for context
Im a 28 year old female who works full time shift work (10 hour shifts anywhere between 8am and 10pm) with people with developmental disabilities.

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent and generalized anxiety (since 2012ish) and I have been medicated since my diagnosis. While I am open to and have considered weaning myself off my meds (once I discuss with my doctor) I don't think I am quite there yet.

I am well aware healthy habits especially for depression include a balanced lifestyle (nutrition, exercise, sleep etc.) And while I do very much try to do my best (whatever that may be on any given day) lately I've been struggling more with my sleep. 

Today I read a story from u/duyenla257 about their battle with waking up early. I would love to be able to have a set routine (sleep by 11pm and up at 7am) but not only does it take me upwards of 30 minutes to fall asleep, I struggle to get out of bed unless I have work or an appointment (instead I will sleep in as long as I can). I'm a very restless sleeper. I've done enough research to know that this could be a side effect of my meds (more lethargic and poor sleep quality) but it has been the only med I have had significant success with managing my depression/anxiety (alternate meds made me paranoid and caused more self harm thoughts).

Working out and a shower before bed can help ease some of the anxiety and I often listen to YouTube medition videos or use fragrentheart.com (which has a excellent audio guided meditions) but I'm finding my usual coping strategies aren't working and I'm almost scared (for no logical purpose) to sleep. This obviously impacts waking up. 

I have tried melatonin (1.5mg or half a 3mg tab) knocks me out but then I struggle even more to wake up and am groggy throughout the day. 

I'm just wondering if anyone out there as any other suggestions for improving sleep quality or if any one else struggles with side effects of meds and how they manage to cope.",3/11/2019
256,GrumpyPanda13,1,"FTP in this forum. 

I  was diagnosed with major depressive disorder reccurant and generalized anxiety as of 2013. 

I have had multiple long term downs over the years but since 2017 have really only had what I refer to as Eeyore days (lethargic, gloomy, overall drained) these maybe last 2-3 days and then I am back to ""normal"" 
For the past 3-4 weeks now I have been sinking lower and lower with no specific trigger. While I am slowly working my way out of it I got to reading and figured I could share some of my coping tools/strategies.

1. Medication
I started meds back in 2013 when things were really bad (I had tried 2 or three before finding one that worked well). Medication helped me regain myself. If its not something your interested in, that's cool; but when you are battling yourself over literally everything, it definitely helps to give yourself a boost. 
I recently went to my Doctor to refill my scripts and she asked how things were. I told her how I've been struggling and after some discussion she suggested increasing my dose. While logically I know this will only benefit me I felt like a failure because instead of getting off the meds, I'm adding. 
Here's the thing though, if you are working out and plateau, do you keep doing the same reps with the same weight? I have been managing my depression for years now and I'm tired (literally and figuratively). 

2. Counselling
I've also done counselling on and off with different counsellors over the years with different levels of success. The important thing here is if you don't click with the counseller to find another one. When I first started counselling again I ended up having a panic attack in the session because while I'm describing this garbled mess which brings me to see this person, she is constantly cutting me off and reminding me we only have a set number of sessions (Employee Assistance Program). This is helpful how? I don't even know where to start because my brain is all garbled and this woman is trying to ""narrow down the problem"" by not actually listening to me. Needless to say when I called back to the EAP centre I asked for someone else. No judgement from them just confirmation that they were not a good match for me. 
Counselling does require some effort on your part which I know can be hard to come by but it helps when someone else can take the nonsense in your brain and break it down for you.

3. Simplify
With depression getting up is hard, getting showered, or fed is hard, literally doing anything is hard. Break down what you ""need"" to do. Don't feel like showering? Brush your teeth or wash your face. Don't want to cook, have some fruit or a granola bar. Laundry or grocery shopping is overwhelming? Figure out what you absolutely need (underwear or toilet paper for example and just get that) you can always build up those tasks over time. Maybe today you can brush your teeth AND wash your face. But take the time you need and if your moving slow focus exclusively on doing that task and how much better your doing because you are doing SOMETHING rather than nothing.

4. Flexibility
My boyfriend works ridiculous hours (early mornings, late nights) I work 10 hour shifts (anywhere from 8am to 10pm) I am the one who cooks because if I left things to my BF he would exist on air and take out. I typically meal plan and prep ahead so that we are not eating out all the time. However when I begin to have a panic attack about all the food I am buying and potentially not using it because I don't have the energy to cook and then it's all going to waste and I'm throwing money away...you get the picture. Instead I grab some frozen pre-packaged meals - while expensive it is cheaper than eating out. While not fantastic health wise - it's better than not eating at all. If you compromise and adjust your expectations of yourself you will be more successful

5. Habit track
I use a habit tracker app. The habits that I have plugged into the app are as a simple as showering or brushing teeth. These are things that I know are helpful for me to feel better - both emotionally and physically. It also only shows 4 days at a time. My rule is if I don't see a check under shower in the past three days then I should really focus me energy on showering. Not only does this help me to keep reasonably clean but also doesn't allow my perfectionist tendencys to go into overdrive because you can adjust how often these habits show up. 

6. Be kind/gentle to yourself and prioritize
This one I still struggle with. I have never really been able to use the think of yourself as your best friend strategy. I know that is works for some but since my friends and I give each other shit to show affection it doesn't really help when you already feel like a piece of shit. Instead I have to remind myself that like a vehicle or a phone I require gas/electricity to run. And right now I am so low on gas/energy that I am require  a lot of rest. You are not being lazy, your are re-charging. Prioritizing what you absolutely need to do can also help with this. You need to go to an appointment, then that's what all of your limited energy is going toward that day. If the rest of your day is spent on the couch or in bed, you managed your task for that day. You rock!

7. The glad game
The biggest and toughest thing is perspective. Especially with depression, your mind likes to spin you down the vortex of doom. This makes it next to impossible to find positive things in your life. Start with three things a day and they can be as simple as ""it's nice outside"" or ""I woke up today"". Again this is something that can build overtime with no real effort because you will automatically start finding more things to be glad/happy about. 
Case in point, driving home from a different city, I take a detour to get home faster, accidently end up heading back in the direction I came. I end up laughing my ass off and calling friends/family to share my extra special fuck up because while inconvenient it was freaking hilarious. 

I'm sorry this was so long but hopefully there are some tools and strategies you have found within to help continue your battle. Please know that ending it is never the answer and there are all kinds of different supports out there to help you.",8/27/2019
257,GrumpyPanda13,0,"Saturday and Sunday were rough work wise due to one of the clients I support having a tough time.
Any and all energy I had saved up over the  5 days of vacation I had was gone.

Monday I managed to clean some of the house and I made it to dance.

I have not showered since (maybe) Friday. And that was at a pool so I'm not sure it really counts as soap was not involved. 
I could not tell you when I last washed my hair (I think I'm going on 2 weeks?)  Or shaved my legs (I was beginning to look like big foot in shorts and I'm female). 

Today I had a brief burst of I want to shave my legs...at 10:30 at night. 

Part of me was saying ""you have work on the morning, you need to go to bed""

The other part of me thought, this is the first time I have had the urge/will to shave my legs in weeks...fucking hell let's do it. 
Not only did I manage to shave but also managed to apply and rinse off soap. 

The entire point of this post (while kinda gross) is to demonstrate how beneficial it is to take advantage of those bursts of ""I want to do -blank-"" 
Whether it's cooking, cleaning, talking to a friend, going out to an event or even just taking care of your basic needs - especially if you are struggling - by taking advantage of those bursts of energy you can find something good in yourself and in your day. And depending on what that burst of energy ends up being for...you might actually feel human again.",9/25/2019
258,GrumpyPanda13,0,"I have been sinking lately. 

I have adjusted my meds with my doc and was seeing a counseller (just finished the set of sessions - haven't set up more yet).

This past weekend was rough work wise. I had Monday and Tuesday off but I felt even worse on Wednesday. Numb/drowning/empty/useless.

I have never self harmed but I currently have long fingernails (something new for me because I am typically a nail biter). And I am finding I will start gripping my arms or legs enough to leave temporary marks but not enough to draw blood. I feel a rush of pain and then recognize I can feel something and stop.

My concern is that this could get worse and lead to more serious self harm. However I don't know if I am freaking out over nothing. I know I need to call my counseller again but I left on such a good note and to have fallen so far in only two weeks I feel like a failure. 

I am not even sure what I am asking to be honest but advice or input or strategies would help.",9/26/2019
259,GrumpyPanda13,0,"A week ago... I was having self harm thoughts and for the first time ever was beginning to use my finger nails to grip my arms or legs...not hard enough to draw blood but enough to leave marks

A week ago... I didn't want to shower or eat or clean or do yoga. I wasn't able to bring myself to use any of my regular coping strategies to help

A week ago... I felt numb, I felt like I was drowning and suffocating.  I asked to invade one of my co-workers space and (once she said yes) sat beside her and put my head on her lap. 

This week I have felt like my regular self. I have attended dance and done yoga, I ate regular and reasonably healthy meals, I have showered every other day and changed my clothes, I was able to clean the house, grocery shop and run a dozen other errands. I have been able to regulate and take breaks and recharge between. 

I recently increased my meds and am feeling  and seeing the improvement. I was attending counselling (just recently finished the set of sessions) and am communicating with my family and friends and co-workers about where I am at.

2010-2014 - college program 1 - biased professors (if they like you, you pass!...they didn't like me... I'm not kidding - the program I was in was specialized and started with 35 individuals... the highest graduation rate was 8) this also triggered my first major depressive episode

2014-2017 - college program 2 - excelled through the school portion...failed 2 seperate placements - and nearly failed out of the third...second major depressive episode triggered... Maybe I just can't work with people?

261,GrumpyPanda13,0,"***DISCLAIMER***
This is in no way intended as a diet/nutrition plan!!!
This is simply a resource for others who may have reached a point where they are:
- unable to eat - due to nausea/lack of energy or just not feeling hungry
- do not have the energy/ability to cook full meals
- are trying to avoid spending ridiculous amounts of money on take out

I have been struggling to the point where my appetite is either non-existent or I feel like I'm going to throw up by eating anything. This is new for me because I typically was always able to manage to eat. I just wanted to share some things I found that have been incredibly helpful to ensure I am at least putting something into my body.

1. Yops (drinkable yogurt) when raising and lowering a spoon is too much energy, these are quick and easy to consume, they come in multiple flavors and while they may have more sugar then healthy yogurt, that extra sugar helps give your body a bit of an energy boost.

2. Pizza pops/pizza pockets - open package, stick em in the microwave and done. 
Typically 2 to a package so on a day where you are feeling a little more ambitious there a good go to

3. Pogos - read above - open, nuke and done. 

4. Frozen dinners/Frozen pizza/Frozen meals - for the days where you need to feed your family, the 10 dollar lasagna is still a hell of a lot cheaper then take out. 

5. Smoothies/protein powder - simply throw it all in the blender, blend and done
Bonus points if you add some fruit and maybe a cup of spinach to get a green vegetable in

6. Mr. Noodles - two cups of water, boil and cook for 2-3 minutes, warm and filling - also comes in a cup option if you are able to make it without somehow burning/igniting it on fire in your microwave

7. Chips/popcorn - again we are going for filling/putting SOMETHING in your tank, not nutrition. This isn't a wonderful option but opening a bag and fulfilling your taste buds a salty cravings is probably better than not eating anything.

262,GrumpyPanda13,3,"Okay so just a disclaimer - Whatever type of treatment is right for you - PERFECT! you do you! 

I have been on the same anti-depressents/anti-anxiety med since...2013 (roughly). I tried a few before I started effexor with great results and minimal side effects.

At the time I hoped that one day in the future I'd be able to decrease/get off of meds cause...isn't that the goal? (Spoiler - no it's not)

FFW to December 2019 - I'm emotionally numb but I think I am still functional...no no I was not - to the point where I had to go off work (k' fine no big deal) 
Assessments and med additions/adjustments and June2020 I'm ready to go back to work...
By the end of August I had slid so far backwards that I was having multiple instances of self harm thoughts daily (which isn't typical for me)

Back off work and playing medication roulette. I try the 4th or 5th med according to Doctor Instructions and have Super Intense and Adverse side effects. 
Stop taking said med (only took it a total of three days) and after Dr. assessment determine we have another one we can try but Dr. wants to wait a week+ to ensure all adverse side effects dissipate. Totally fair.

HOWEVER - this means I am off ALL anti depressents/anti- anxiety meds...

All of this to say - if anyone, ever is pressuring you to go off your meds, or you think your better and don't need the meds any more (and I mean this with all the love in my heart) but GO FORKING POUND SALT!!! 

YOU KNOW HOW DIABETICS NEED INSULIN TO LIVE?? YEAH! APPARENTLY SAME GOES FOR DEPRESSIVE/ANXIETY TYPES!!

Now don't get me wrong (reference disclaimer) You do you, any treatment options that work for you - go for it BUT just to give you a glimpse of the past TWO days

I have been: 
-Uncontrollably crying (unusual for me) with no apparent cause
-Scared to the point of panic attacks of going to sleep
- Having panic attacks at night because I am also going to be violently attacked by...something
- Crazy stress dreams when I do manage to fall asleep
-Having multiple instances of self harm thoughts
-Having uncontrollable thoughts in general which include but are not limited to: I am a worthless human being, I can't do anything right, it would be better if I weren't here - so on so forth
- panic attacks over my pets or family members dying (all are in good health) 
- brain fog so thick that I can't even type clearly and honestly don't know how much of my rambling is making sense


When writing it out like that - my initial thoughts are - it's not that bad, I just need to suck it up and try harder...and then I take a few steps back and go... No - those are not things that should be occuring to the extent and intensity that it is. 


Medication is what helps my brain to function. I have other tools and supports that I apply and use but in order to have even a CHANCE of battleling myself I need anti-depressents/anti-anxiety meds.

I don't know why I felt so compelled to write this but just remembering that my inital ""goal"" was to eventually get off medications...and thinking of how stigmatized mental health is in general and how so many people are unable to even get the help they DO need...I just wanted to share my experience with going off medication because maybe it can help someone else in some way.",3/4/2021

I've been sitting here shaking for the past 20 minutes trying not to cry. What can I do?

It's a small business I don't have an HR department or anyone higher to go to (my boss is the owner of the company) and I don't have benefits or paid sick days or anything like that to cover if I wanted to take time off to help.

I used to be right obsessed with doing my makeup, I would wake up extra early to go full glam every day for years. I spent at least an hour on my face each morning. When my mental health started to deteriorate, I one day snapped and did nothing more than mascara and some days brows for over a year (with the exception of 2 weddings I actually put the effort in).

Thirdly, if you are self diagnosed or have not gotten medical/ therapeutical help, what are you doing to manage/ improve your condition? 

I only ask because I look back now and realize that getting help was the best thing ever, I can actually function most days now. I know how hard it is to get help but there wasn’t an option for me to just “live with it”, like it seems some people do, because of how much it impacted me, I needed to get help.

300,Ilac21,1,"I went for lunch with my (24F) mom (41F) and 4 sisters (18F)(14F)(14F)(12F) and I am fresh our of spoons for the rest of my work day.

Lunch started off bad, I was annoyed that everyone had already ordered and gotten their food when I arrived even though I arrived at the agreed upon time (they all showed up early).

I went on to talk about a trip my boyfriend (28M) and I are going on where we will get to visit his daughter who recently moved with her mother several hours from us. His daughter lives with her mother so that she can be with her younger sister, not because of any disputes or anything, we can go visit her any time.

From here my sister (18F) starts going on about how awful of a parent my boyfriend is because he doesn't live close to his  daughter, without knowing the slightest detail about the situation she makes all these assumptions. She goes on calling him a deadbeat and here is where I feel myself starting to spiral.

Trying to change the subject, I show my mom a tattoo I got recently with my sister (18F), to show her how it was healing. My sister (18F) interrupts the conversation to say how awful the tattoo artist we went to was and how her tattoo was so screwed up, I was there and the reason it is bad is because she wouldn't stop moving and she made him stop 10 minutes in because she couldn't handle the pain. 

Again, I tried to change the subject to avoid escalating the situation, I mention that my sister (14F) was having a birthday party on the weekend and that I was excited to come with my boyfriend and our dog. My sister (18F) interrupts the conversation AGAIN talking about how a guy she knows lives near where the party is taking place, and that this guy has a girlfriend but he ""tried to fuck her"". She loudly said those exact words in a crowded restaurant with children.

At this point I was fed up and kept my mouth shut for the rest of lunch. I told my mom if she acts the way she did today when we see them on the weekend I wont be sticking around and my mom understood.

334,LadyAwesome713,0,"I just feel sad ALL THE TIME. I don't remember the last time I was truly happy and enjoyed my life. I was diagnosed with depression in high school, but I can't remember a time before that when I didn't have it. It had never affected me to the point I feel crippled before. It was hard, of course, but I felt like I had a support group and people to talk to. I was able to be strong and put on a brave face and feel like everything would be okay.
And then the only people I ever felt close to and opened up to turned their backs on me, and now I have trust issues and can't get close to anyone. They broke me. I needed them, and they betrayed me. I keep people at arm's length, I know that, but I can't seem to let anyone else in. Instead, I just hurt those I care about.
I'm not the same person I use to be. I use to be hopeful and optimistic and a dreamer. Now, I'm bitter, I'm pessimistic, I'm paranoid. I cry ALL THE TIME. I never use to cry, not like this. I was strong and went on adventures, but now I feel like I'm trapped in my own mind. I rarely leave the house, I don't have any real friends, I don't do any of the things I love to do. I want to runaway, but I have nowhere to go, no one to help me. If anything, I wish I could flip a switch that would quiet all the voices in my head, just for a little bit.
I miss the person I was. I've tried to be her, but she's gone. Too much has happened to her, too many people have hurt her.

335,LadyAwesome713,0,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now, living together just over 3 years. We live with my parents due to finance trouble. I love him and he loves me, and it kills me inside knowing my family's disdain for him.

I know my dad hates that he can't find a ""normal"" steady job. He does odd jobs, and gets hired seasonally places but never gets to stay on. The odd jobs he finds through friends, and does what he can to contribute. But my dad is traditional - as much as he supports me and believes I can do whatever I set my mind to, he's also old school. He was raised to think that a man should financially take care of his family, even if the woman works. And he thinks odd jobs aren't a legit way to provide. (Mind you, my boyfriend will be starting school soon to learn a trade so he *can* get a ""normal"" job, but that doesn't matter to my dad.) He also hates that my bf and I split chores fifty/fifty (we'll both clean the kitchen, take out the trash, feed the animals, etc.) For some reason.

My sister hates anyone who spends time with me pretty much, since it means I'm not spending time with her, but she makes it very obvious she doesn't like my bf. She thinks that he controls me (which is so far from the truth - he usually lets me get my way), because I try new things with him, I go on adventures with him, and I never use to do that sort of stuff. So obviously, he's controlling every aspect of my life. She picks a fight with every chance she gets. When he goes out with friends, she makes snarky comments about how she ""thought he didn't have any money"" to go out, even though he just goes over to his friends' house. My sister is a narcissist and verbally abusive towards me; she's constantly screaming at me or chewing me out for something. But my boyfriend isn't allowed to tell her to back off, because I ""can speak for myself"" (even though I try to speak up to her, but all it ever does is make her tell more), and then she gets mad at him when he storms off angry that she's yelling at me.

My boyfriend is an amazing guy. He's never, ever, raised a hand to me, no matter how angry he gets with me. He's gone out of his way to help build my self-esteem and help me over come all my crazy. He always takes care of me when I'm sick. He helps me through my dark episodes when the depression us too much. He makes sure I stay in school so I can do what I want to do with my life. He supports me in everything I do, as long as it's not something hurtful, even if he's totally against it. He has severe ADHD and anxiety, but will go out of his way to make me happy even if it means doing something he's not comfortable with (of course, I rarely ask him to, if ever). He has the biggest heart I've ever seen - he would give the shirt off his back to anyone who needed it, be it a homeless person or a best friend. So I truly don't know what's so bad.

It breaks my heart. It was bad enough the only friends I had wouldn't accept me having a bf, but my own family won't either. We plan on getting married after we've finished school, but I honestly dread it more than I'm excited by it. I know my family isn't going to give those heart-warming speeches or approve of him, ever. And it just makes me...sad. I always thought my friends and family would accept who I bring home as long as he makes me truly happy and doesn't abuse me. And having to deal with it every single day with no escape...it's exhausting and heartbreaking.

Sorry, just needed to rant a little. Thanks for listening💜",7/20/2019
336,LadyAwesome713,2,"Some short background: I live in a very toxic home right now, the same one I've lived in my entire life. My family (mostly my sister, but my parents too sometimes), is verbally abusive. My sister is by far the worst one. She's narcissistic, selfish, rude, petty, immature, and has almost no empathy for other people. She will do something that the sole purpose is to just make a person angry (i.e. she leaves my room angry and won't shut the door just because I want it shut, but I made her mad so I have to do it myself. Not a big deal, but just trying to give a good example). She won't offer to help with anything ever, but if you ask her for help, she won't do it because you asked her to help.

Now for the point of this post.


I know who I use to be. I feel like I know who I want to be, and I think that I try to be that person, but then I'll get in an argument with my sister and I start to question myself. I've always thought that I try to be a good person, don't cause conflict, don't put people down or make fun of them, be selfless. But my sister constantly tells me how I'm selfish because I don't want to do something for/with her, or that I don't take care of my mom like I need to (my mom is really disabled, and I *do* take care of her), that I'm going to be a terrible mom because I don't like to share my food or drinks, that I hate her because I don't want to hang out with her, that I never do anything for her, I'm childish because I lock myself in the bathroom when I don't want to argue with her anymore, etc. And now, I keep questioning who's right - am I the person I think I am or am I who she makes me out to be?

I'm not an overly affectionate person; I'm not a hugger, not even to family really. The only person I feel comfortable with is my boyfriend. My family forced hugs and kisses and goosing (where you pinch the butt) and just touching in general on me growing up. I was sexually assaulted a few years ago. I just don't like to be touched. And my sister (and the rest of my family, for that matter) don't care. They want a hug? I have to give it to them because they're family. And my sister will hold me down and hug me, which is worse because I'm claustrophobic. And because I'm not one to show affection, it means I'm a heartless person and that I don't care about anyone except myself (she also says this when I give up and stop talking when we ""fight"", which is really just an hour of her yelling at me).

I avoid doing anything I love doing because I'm so scared someone (again, usually my sister) is going to tell me how it sucks or how stupid it is. I don't play music anymore because it ""sounds like I'm killing a cat,"" I don't paint when other people are home because ""I don't know how to make art,"" I don't play video games much anymore because ""I'm not doing it right"" or I should be ""doing something productive"" like clean up after her. Really the only thing I will do these days is read, and even then, the books I read are ""boring and I should read this other book instead"" (I read mystery/thriller novels, so tell me how they're boring).

I hide away in my room all day in fear that I'm going to do something to set my sister off (honestly, if I breathe too loudly, she gets angry) and have her start yelling at me again. I'm tired of not even knowing what kind of person I am anymore, because I 100% haven't the slightest clue. I know I let her get in my head, but after 13+ years of dealing with her, I just don't know what's true and what's not. Everytime I think I'm finding myself again, the cycle starts over.

My family (I live with my parents and younger sister) is toxic, and every time I do something that helps me relax and gives me a little bit of an escape from reality, they have to comment on how bad I am at it or that I shouldn't be wasting time doing it when there's dishes to be washed and floors to be mopped. I am a full time student and I work two jobs, so I rarely have time for myself as it is, but they expect me to spend my free time cleaning up after them. The only times I leave my room are to get food or leave the house, so I don't contribute much to the messes made around the house but am still required to clean everyone else's messes. I don't have many friends that are available to hang out often, and I live in a small town with not much to do, so I don't even have a place to go hide out for a while if I need to besides my car.

She still lives upstate, about 6 hours away, but we use to be able to make it work. Then, I started hearing from her less and less. I knew she was going through some things after her brother died, so I tried not push it. But now, I don't even get a happy birthday text. I see pictures of her out partying with other friends of hers that same day, but she can't take 30 seconds to send me a text. It's been this way for about 3 years now. I've tried to talk to her about it, but I guess it didn't help. When she comes to town to visit family, she can't even set aside more than 20 minutes for me. 

I know that I sound jealous or whatever, but she's always said how she loves me as family and can't see a life without me and that she'll always be there for me, yet I can't even text her when I need a friend.

We don't do anything for Thanksgiving anymore except go to a buffet, which isn't for another few hours.

They just hate when they can't control a situation and so their solution is to try to convince and manipulate me into doing things the way they think it should be. And when I don't or when I refuse to tell them something because I'm 25 years old and my life really isn't any of their business, then all of a sudden they can't trust me anymore and I'm the bad guy.

It's been a long night. I can't believe it's only one night...

My fiance has been at a friend's house out of town for a week. He finally came home last night. I just wanted to spend time together, watch a movie or something. But all we did was fight. Because he wanted me to go with him back to his friend's house for the weekend. I didn't want to go. Firstly, his friend shares a house with his parents, girlfriend, and two kids, and has another friend visiting from out of town. And I know none of these people, besides the friend. I'm already an anxious person, and Ive had a rough week emotionally, so I was in no shape to meet all these new people. Secondly, my parents are older, and we live with them for the time being, and I don't want to keep pushing our luck and bring home the coronavirus. My fiance says they've all been tested and that they don't go anywhere, but I still don't want to take a chance.

So I explain all this to him, I even start to have a break down. He starts to get upset, my parents get nosey (""because it's their house and they have a right to know everything that goes on"") and say something, which only makes it worse. I of course just shut down because I'm not good with loud situations. I let my fiance just rant and continue his anger explosion (non-violent, don't worry). This goes on for hours. Finally, he calms down enough to where I can talk (after I've already snuck off to the bathroom to have a good cry). I ask him questions like what he would do if I wasn't here, if he'd be able to find someone else, if he'd be happy eventually, etc. Of course he asks why I want to know, and I break down as I confess that I feel like I can't handle all of this anymore and have been thinking about how easy it would be to just ""leave.""

He does the usual thing, saying he won't leave me alone for a while or whatever. Doesn't really comfort me, but tells me how much he loves me and so on. Maybe 5, 10 minutes later, we're back on him being angry and just wanting to leave. As usual when we're in the middle of an argument, his friend calls. He hears his friends laughing and having fun and of course it makes everything worse. Finally, I tell him to go. That he would have to stay for 2 weeks, just to make sure he doesn't have any symptoms or anything. I said we can video chat or call or something and that I'd be okay. He got ready to leave, saying the entire time that he doesn't want to leave me and that he feels bad. But he still left.

I'm not okay. I cried for almost 2 hours after he was gone. I still couldn't fall asleep. I took a muscle relaxer (I have a prescription for my back pain) to ease myself to sleep. What I hadn't thought about was the vertigo I've been having. The muscle relaxer made it 10 times worse and I couldn't even blink without the room spinning. It didn't make me sleepy really, but I was relaxed I guess. I stayed on that weird edge between sleep and wake most of the night, sick to my stomach from all the dizziness, and the room spinning around me. I finally gave up around 5am, and now I'm back at the wanting to ball my eyes out stage.

The worst part is that I'm still stuck at home with my toxic family and have to handle the fallout from last night all by myself. I just feel so alone...I can't see myself surviving these next two weeks, but I know I have to. All I wanted was a night alone together...but now I feel like he doesn't even really care about what I want if it interferes with what he wants. I love him so much, and I can't see myself with anyone else. He really is a good hearted guy, but he can be so selfish sometimes, and I don't have anyone else to talk to about this stuff. I just wanted him to hold me and tell me everything will be okay...or even just a hug... I've never felt so alone before and I really don't know what to do with myself now besides cry.

Of feeling like everything wrong in my family is my fault; of feeling like I'm a horrible daughter, sister, and overall person; of nobody thinking I'm smart enough to know what I'm talking about; of being so confused as to who I really am. The worst part is that I've been conditioned to think that it's all my own doing. That if only I were more caring, or more selfless, or better in every way, then everything would be fixed because its all my fault to begin with. I don't want to die, not really. But I also don't see a reason that everyone wouldn't be better off if I'm gone. I try so hard to do better, but its never enough. I can't remember what it's like to feel truly happy or carefree.

I don't have friends who I feel comfortable enough with to talk to about any of this. My fiance is great...when he's actually around. He's always at his friend's house, working on more stupid cars.

345,LadyAwesome713,2,"So, school just started. I transferred to a CSU this semester, finally, from a community college. I've been at community college for a LONG time, so I was very excited to finally transfer. And then quarantine happened. This means my entire first year at University is online. I'm not good with online classes normally, and I'm an English major, meaning I have all/mostly English classes. Those are hard enough in-person. But okay, I'll get through it.

I knew that with the transfer comes lots of new paperwork, so I made sure to start it early on. Like before I even graduated from CC, which was May 2020. So I fill out all the paperwork I need to, then a few months later, it says I need to fill out MORE paperwork for financial aid. I do that, and I check my account every day to see if something has changed. Finally it says I've completed everything, but 2 weeks go by and I still haven't heard anything from the school about when/if I'll be receiving my financial aid. I try to call the school, but I always end up on hold for hours and have to hang up due to class/work. I try to use their online chat, but it's always offline. I finally just email them. I get a response yesterday saying that my aid was awarded on the 26th and I will be receiving it Friday (today). I hop on this morning to check and... nothing. By now, I'm so frustrated with everything that I'm practically shaking. I'm able to get ahold of someone in the financial aid office via the chat feature, and I'm told that they STILL HAVE TO REVIEW MY APPLICATION. Apparently, they can't review the grant until it's been awarded, and they have to do it manually, and there's a whole lot of students ahead of me. It'll take AT LEAST 2 weeks to finish the review and get my refund.

And of course, I'm not getting the amount I was originally told (near $12,000 per semester). I'm barely getting a quarter of that (LESS THAN $3,000). FOR UNIVERSITY. I received twice as much at CC! I don't understand why I'm getting so much less from 2 grants compared to what I got from 1 grant at CC. And, the grant I received already went fully into my tuition...AND I STILL OWE $955.

The icing on the cake is that the brand new $300 phone I bought (I've never spent this much on a phone, mind you. I was just tired of my cheap phones dying on me so soon and having to replace them every year) I accidentally threw in the washer, as it was wrapped up in my sheets. I've NEVER done anything like this to my electronics and am usually really careful with checking and shaking things out before they go into the washer. It was only in there like 2 minutes, if that, but it was fully submerged. It's going to cost as much to fix it as it will to just buy a new one...which I can't do without the financial aid.

And of course, to make the situation so much worse, I live in an extremely toxic household. The first amount I was told I was receiving for financial aid, paired with what I make from work, was enough to help my fiancee and I to move out on our own finally and get some space from my family. It's not going to happen now. Not with such a small amount of financial aid. Even with my fiancees 2 jobs, we don't make enough to move out.

Even better, I'm in danger of loosing my job because of COVID. I work for a CC as a tutor, and because we're fully online now, our numbers for how many students we get have severely dropped. If we don't get the numbers up, they might shut us down.

I just can't take it anymore. I'm literally at the end of my rope and I'm losing whatever's left of my mind. I've been trying to hold myself together, but I dread waking up every day for fear of what else will go wrong. Idk what I'm looking for here.

425,Roadmapsforthesoul,3,"For the past decade or so I've been perpetually tired. A lot of it is linked to depression and stress I'm sure, so for the past few months I've been on Lexapro. My mental state has improved somewhat but I'm still constantly battling fatigue. I wake up tired, usually have a  small window of feeling awake, and a few hours later I'm tired again. I'm addicted to energy drinks because they help with the fatigue and my mood, but it's always just a battle to hold off the wave of fatigue.

I'm wondering what experiences others have had with this, and what has worked for them?",1/8/2019
426,Roadmapsforthesoul,3,"Lexapro has been a godsend for me. I'm currently on 20 mgs and it has completely transformed my mood and my overall quality of life. 

I've recently entered a new relationship and while I'm loving the sex, it hasn't come without sexual side effects. Initially I flat out couldn't become aroused. I was then prescribed  150 mgs of Wellbutrin, and while I can now become aroused enough to perform, I can hardly ever climax, which really sucks. I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck with combating this issue?",4/9/2019
427,Roadmapsforthesoul,1,I've been on lexapro and in therapy for about 6 months. I've also been diagnosed with pervasive depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I've been working through a lot and I'm having a hard time letting go of resentments I have against my parents for never changing their behaviors. My Dad was always depressed and my Mom is so anxious that she goes zero to a hundred over small things. I recently told my therapist that I felt like they didn't hear me when I was growing up and they don't hear me now. I don't feel that they ever tried to reach me and hear me. They just continued their behaviors. Has anyone else had a similar experience with depression and their parents?,5/23/2019
428,Roadmapsforthesoul,5,"It's becoming increasing apparent that my parents just don't listen to me. I think it has always been this way. They've been stuck I  the same behavior patterns for as long as they've been together, and my sister and I just had to adapt. My Dad has been inconsistent emotionally, meaning that he's been depressed my entire life, but sometimes comes out of it. I'm 29 years old and at this point in my life I'm used to his brand of emotional terrorism. I grew up with him coming home from work everyday sighing, and reacting to my accomplishments with ""hmph"".

My Mom is a different story. She has a habit of bringing up a different topic in the middle of something I'm saying. For example saying ""You need to take the garbage out"" while I'm talking about something else. She always goes zero to one hundred over absolutely nothing. I've discussed some of this with my therapist, and about what he considers to be a somewhat toxic environment, though I know they don't mean it. My issue here is that I don't think they're trying. I've literally heard my Dad say, ""She'll never change"" referring to my Mom.

I don't feel that they've ever changed their behaviors to fit issues my sister and I have had. I've been diagnosed with Pervasive Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and I don't feel that they've ever really adapted their behaviors. I don't think they've considered that their actions and vibes may be triggers, enough to attempt to change.

431,Roadmapsforthesoul,0,"I think one of the most difficult parts about trying to move forward with healing in regards to depression, is the idea that you can't change your parents. I'm 29 years old and work as a behavior analyst mostly for children diagnosed with autism. I think one of the main reasons I got into behavior modification is because my parents have largely refused to change their behavior, even when they see the negative effect it has had on both my sister and I.

My childhood was a good one in the traditional sense. I was provided for, given shelter, food, all that stuff. But my parents were mental terrorists so to speak. My Dad was depressed my entire life, coming home from work sighing, and according to my Mom, very tough on me. You know, the classic, you'll never be enough routine. My Mom was always stressed. Things always felt like they were on the verge of a complete implosion, so it makes sense that I spent 10 years 18-28ish, living with a depression that came with this feeling of sudden impending doom in my gut, do to living with two people who are super inconsistent emotionally.

I've made changes in my life such as going to therapy, getting on medication, and really trying to accept that you can't change your parents, but the latter has proved to be very difficult. It's very frustrating to me that my Mom refuses to make changes to curb her over the top anxiety that can literally destroy an entire outing, or that my Dad refuses to even try to tackle his demons. Every day with them is like a twilight zone episode where the result is always the same. Half the time I feel like I'm parenting them.

485,anxious-wreck,0,"I know that it's kind of a long post but I really wanted to write this down in hopes of anybody feeling like trying to help me, I don't know.

My therapist told me last Monday that she thinks it's necessary for me to go to a psychiatrist and see the possibility of taking antidepressants and anxiolytics (anxiolytics for OCDish behavior) or what said psychiatrist thinks is the best option for me, because I'm constantly having catastrophic thoughts and I **can't not think**. Plus, I've felt very down for a good while and she told me that it's something that I haven't been able to handle on my own, and that they were in fact depressive thoughts in hand with a depressed mood and so many other things that I'm too tired to think about right now.

The thing is, looking up things on the internet I don't feel like I'm *enough* for such meds. I see people who literally cannot get out of bed and, although all I think about all day long is being on my bed, I can get out of bed and I can do so many things that others can't. I've seen people who think about self-harm and/or suicide, and I don't. I've never thought about killing myself nor think I ever will, and the only harmful thing I've done to myself is pulling my hair off. I have laughs and feel pretty good when around people, but when I'm alone I feel pathetic and I feel like I can't do anything (and so many more negative things about myself and I obsess over those thoughts and just repeat the cycle). 

My therapist told me that I'm a person that can function pretty well, even with these horrible thoughts and with my mood being pretty low, but that I could be better with these meds. 

If I take the meds, I'm afraid that I will feel like I'm a burden to my family because my sister already takes antidepressants, antipsychotics and meds for ADD. I just feel like they'll be like ""ah, another one"".

I've been told all my life that I can handle shit on my own and that I'm smart and strong and I'll get over things, and I don't know if that's playing any role in how I'm feeling with this thing of taking meds. I just don't feel strong nor smart nor any of those things that I've been told in the past. 

EDIT: Plus, I don't wake up thinking ""here we go again"". That just doesn't happen to me and I feel like I'm faking everything out for attention, although I know I'm not. I don't know, I feel like I'm such a fake ass person who doesn't deserve to be heard because everything he says is a lie.

EDIT Nº2: I was bullied almost all throughout my school years for being gay and I've never (or almost never) felt decent, never felt pretty, never felt good enough for people, I always try to impress others but I'm just tired of everything, I'm tired of all of that. I just want to be like I once was, I once was such a joyful kid who loved the outdoors, I loved the sun, I loved the summer, I loved almost everything and didn't care about many things. Now I'm a sad, introverted person who hates the summer, hates the sun, hates going out. I don't feel joy nor happiness in what I once thought were beautiful landscapes or just a good view. I just don't feel anything. Of course I can feel very happy and have a good laugh and everything but where's the other feelings I once was able to feel?",10/1/2017

She started talking about what she wants to do after she's done studying and about studying abroad and she explained her discipline in such a great way, like she's really into it and honestly it's great and I would have been so happy with the conversation... but my dad asked me about mine.

I didn't know what to do or say and I just felt like such a fucking dumbass, like I don't even know what I'm doing in life and I'll never achieve anything because I'm stupid, I'm lazy, I'm disgusting and so many more things. I just tried to get off the topic as quickly as I could and now I'm here, alone in my bed holding in the tears (that probably won't even come off, lately I've been feeling like crying a TON but for some reason my body just won't do it), feeling like I am worth 0.

487,anxious-wreck,6,"I posted this on OCD but maybe more people will read it here idk

I’m sorry for the long post but people just can’t fucking understand, please at least give me an opinion on this, please.

people keep telling me “just don’t think about that”, “don’t do this”, “don’t do that”, fuck off people, fuck. right. off.

my older sister (23) was diagnosed with BPD and Depression by the beginning of this year and whenever she’s feeling down i’m **100% always** there to listen to her and let her express her feelings, and I never **EVER** mistreat or yell at her for saying things that aren’t correct, such as having a family that constantly critiques her and thinks about her like she’s a stupid person who’ll never do anything and that we’ll abandon her. That’s not correct. We love her to death and if anything ever happens to her we would be lost. Even the thought of leaving her alone or even thinking about her feeling alone makes me cry because I love her so much.

I (19) have struggled with criticism a **LOT** for my whole life and I apparently tend to misinterpret what people are actually telling me. For example, they think my psychiatrist prescribed me with the wrong meds (which, realistically, can happen and i’m willing to talk to him about it), but the way they say it is like “you need to change that”, “do this”, “do that”, “who the fuck is your psychiatrist” and those things make me feel like I’m fucking dumb, like I’m useless and will always go for the worst option for me and I’ll never get out of anything alone. 

When I told her that I didn’t need criticism she started yelling at me like I was so incorrect and that I needed to stop thinking those things because she’s not responsible for my interpretations of what she’s saying, because I’m the one who’s listening what I want to listen to (which, by the way, makes me feel even worse because it’s even more criticism). She said that if I like the bad side effects that paxil and clotiazepam have on me then that’s my boat and I should just continue (it’s a weird story, I struggle with intrusive thoughts about not being able to sleep so I like the fact that I’m feeling weak and tired because it calms me down, making me feel like I will be able to sleep, and the cycle continues and **I KNOW IT’S WRONG** but I can’t stop it, and that makes me feel fake and stupid and ugh.

When I told her that, she kept criticising me and told me that I just want people to say “oh poor you, poor you!!!” and kept shouting that until she left the room and I was begging her to stop. I never act this way and I always try and not say things that’ll make her feel worse, because I’m not trying to make her sink even deeper but she keeps making me sink and sink and sink and I don’t know if she’s deliberately doing it (I’m trying to convince myself that she’s not) but I can’t do this anymore, I don’t want to feel bad by these things but it’s obviously making me feel even worse.

I didn't want to eat but I had to, so I forced myself to make myself something to eat and went straight back to bed, now I'm here writing this down.

People put social rights aside and just want the ""communists out"" (which for some reason for them communist means everybody who is not a straight while male/female who has a shit ton of money).

523,anxious-wreck,0,"If I had the opportunity to meet and talk with myself 12 years ago, an 8 year old ... I would say that he will suffer a lot in school, which will block many feelings as a mechanism so that those comments would not hurt him so much and all of the teasing too, but he can not afford to block them so much because when he is an adult that will have serious consequences. I am now 20 years old and I try to feel bad because for many years I ruined my life by ignoring everything that happened to me, following the advice I was told from time to time where I had to pretend that I was not bothered by bullying and that I was slipping away the comments of others. I would tell myself that my parents are not going to be together again, that even though that same year (2005) my parents told me that my dad would return to the house after a couple of days, that would never happen... Divorces happen.

If I could talk to me at 9 years old, I would say yes, that his classmates are starting to annoy him and call him effeminate and gay and queer and many other disgusting words that ended up making me a being who ignores his own mental processes in order to never let the insults get to him, Sometimes it's not healthy to try to move forward. I would tell me to go and talk as much as possible with my great-grandmother because in a couple of years she would no longer be with us, she loves you, she brings peace to your mother who is suffering a lot, please do not be cruel to your mother, do not be too demanding because she is suffering a lot. Fufu (my pet) will arrive on December 16th of the same year (2006) and believe me it will make your life very happy, that for 11 years later (we're in 2017) it will be one of the few reasons that keep you alive. I would say that there are times when you think you have friends but in reality those are not real friends, that you will simply seek in the future to go for your own good and you will be disappointed, but keep calm, do not repress your feelings, keep the smile that you always maintained for so long and keep seeking happiness. I would say that you do not take care of a possible problem with fires for a problem that happened only once and never again (once my house almost burnt down and I was 8 years old and I tried to take control), please do not repeat it in your head, try to control it and please do not become what I have become, an obsessive, a depressive, a suicidal, a person who does not know how to feel, or rather, does not know how to recognize whether he feels or not.

If I could talk to me at 10 years old in 2007, I would tell myself that things are going to start getting complicated. You will have a ""girlfriend"" that lasted 1 day (in reality women will not attract you so much in the future, or not at all). 

I would say that please return that cell phone that you found to her owner, do not steal it because it is her phone, it is not yours. I would say that life still has a chance to be good, that if you do not like physical education it's okay, that there's nothing wrong with not wanting to change your clothes in front of your schoolmates because you do not need to, but that after physical education you can not escape from showering and cleaning yourself because it will bring you problems. People will continue to bother you a little, maybe less than in previous years but the bullying is still there ... Please Matt, you are 10 years old and I know you can talk to your parents, do not make the mistake I made. Your parents love you, they adore you.

I would tell myself not to fight with Pepa (my sister), Pepa is having a very bad time, Pepa is discovering that she is a lesbian and does not feel support anywhere ... Please do not argue with her, she is going through a horrible depressive episode and needs of your love.

If I could talk to me at 11 years old in 2008, I would say that your ""friend"" Phillip may seem like a good friend but in one more year he will disappoint you, please Matt, get away a little, at least during this time. They'll call you fat, they'll call you gay, effeminate, they'll tell you to do something good sometime because you never do anything right, they'll tell you to leave, they'll call you foolish and other insults that I know will affect you but I beg you, please be strong but if that you do not achieve it, do not hate yourself over it it, it's good to have a cry every now and then ... You're not weak for crying. 

Give all your support (as much as you can) to your mother and your sister, give them love, you are a happy child, you can cheer them up. Your mom is going through a bad period, you need to concentrate on yourself, not the problems.

If I could talk to myself at age 12 in 2009 I would beg myself to please do not listen to Richard ... He will call you gay, effeminate, fat, obese, tell you he wants to beat you up and also tell that to others in order to have a group of people beat you up . He will influence others who you thought you liked at school but those people will come back at some point, do not feel alone ... School is not the best place, believe me I know, but it's the place you have to go to. People make fun of you, I know ... Please do not let that destroy you, please do not feel compelled to seek attraction in women because it is something that you will later know is impossible in your case, and that is okay!... You are a beautiful person, you are a precious child who is adored by his family.

Do not become what I have become, an empty person. Phillip will betray you and that's something that I know you can not forget so easily, he was a great friend after all ... but that's over. You wanted to fit in your group but it is not necessary that you have to do it, please do not suffer, please, please do not suffer. School is a bad place for you, but believe me you will find people you will love. You will find others at college, Elena, Carla, Isabela and Nicole ... but above all you will find your boyfriend Nick at some point. Your life will be fine ... I myself can not see it at this moment, but if you make the effort I know you can do it ... Do not be like I am, I have failed myself. 

Moving on to 2010, you will be 13 years old! You are growing up and that is very good because you have more tools to endure what is coming ... Richard left school and I know that it makes you feel better, less threatened, but I want to tell you that the problems will not end there. Please, tell your parents if you are having a bad time, do not suppress it, although I know you're ashamed of it. You'll one day meet Esteban and you are going to think that he is very cut.. your first crush on a guy. This will confuse you and you will feel very strange and confused... There will come moments of fear, of confusion, of not being able to recognize yourself. You will believe that it is better if you were a woman because it would not be wrong if you liked him, but that is not the case. There is nothing wrong with being homosexual and someday you will realize that! I am managing to feel good with that, and 7 years have passed since I began to doubt my sexuality. 

I know that you have felt lonely for years, that you have felt that you have only one friend but believe me that she is a beautiful person, believe me. You are not alone, you are with her ... Please take good care of that friendship, unlike I did, where I mistreated my only friend and now we are almost strangers ... I miss her, a lot. 

There's nothing wrong with maths being difficult for you, it's fine! It's not your area, please do not think you're crap and useless just because you do not like math, because it's not like that. 

Look for a lot of support in your family, please ... They love you. Growing more and more is as if you were developing a very strong shell that you think prevents you from hurting from the comments of others, the screams, the insults, the laughter, the looks ... This shell is not as strong as you think ... Mine broke, mine no longer exists and I see no way out. Please, please please please do not let them break it, get away from all the comments of the others, get away from those disgusting people who insult you. You will feel alone in this world, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone. Please come forward, not like me. Do not listen to the comments of Pauline and Luke, they will call you ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, horrible, disgusting ... DO NOT listen to them, please. Do not listen to the comments of your classmates telling you fat, obese, ugly, monkey face, fag, you suck, you have progeria, that you have AIDS, that nobody will ever love you, please don't.

There will be many problems in your life, problems that people will invalidate you and everybody will feel very dismissive, very indifferent ... Matt, you are on the right track and others do not want to see it. I was on the right track but I let myself go, I let myself be carried away by the current of the river that did not allow me to rejoin myself.

The pain that it brings is unbearable, please ask for help. It is here (2010-2011) where this ""Matt 2"" will be developed and I admit that I have a bit of a grudge against him, since all he does is insult me but I am the one who does it, I could've controlled that but I did not succeed and now it's driving me crazy. Please, you can avoid it ... Not like me, I fell under pressure. I no longer see reasons to continue living, I will not do anything bad nor kill myself because I still have a little confidence that I can be the happy child I once was. Unfortunately I have suffered hard moments followed by good times, but I know that you can be a happy person, I believe in you. I love who you are, I do not love who I am today. You are a happy child, a happy child, a child who will suffer, you will suffer a lot. I do not know who I am, please look for something that will help you define yourself as a person, do not be a nobody like I am, do not be a person without opinions, without any position, without happiness, without stability ... Please do not fall into what I have fallen. Matt... I love you ... I miss being you. 

In short, there are many things in this letter that I have forgotten to tell you because (oh, surprise) I have no brain to continue thinking at this moment, I am exhausted, exhausted, exhausted. As for example Pepa, your idol in the whole Universe is suffering ... please help her within what you can and do not be as I was, do not insult her, do not call her stupid, psychotic, crazy, suicidal ... HELP HER.

I regret the disgust of a person who at some time I was with her, I love Pepa and I know that you too. You will be fine, please listen to me and do not fall into what I have fallen.

Matt, I promise you that I, I will not commit suicide ... I promise. I am doing my best to find some purpose to keep living but I am failing. I have good days and bad days, do not fall into the sense of feeling fake in which I have fallen. Please Matt, I'm begging you. I would love to defend and save you, but I can not even defend myself ... I am worthless, you are worth a lot. The only way out of this disgusting place I see is death, but I'm a coward and I never would it.

Also, I think about the people that I love and that makes me cry, I do not want to hurt them if I die but I also feel that I hurt them and I get them upset while they are alive ... I want to get away, I want to be alone, I want to cry, I want to scream, I want to scream.
 
I'd tell myself that I'll be bullied until I'm 18, that it's going to bring horrible consequences that will make him suicidal, that his family is not going to bring the support you need but they still love and support you, even though it does not seem like it ... They really are trying. I'd tell myself to try and connect to my emotions because I've become an emotionless, lifeless human being without any purpose. I'd tell him that he must find his interests .... please do it, younger me. I'd tell myself that life will be fucked up but that I must stay strong, I'd tell myself that it's okay to be gay and to not hate that part of myself. I'd tell myself so many things, but mainly I'd tell him to not surrender like I did and I just let myself be destroyed by others and by myself.

I keep telling myself how dumb and numb I have become, how I should die, how worthless I am, how I wish I had not treated myself like this. I'd tell myself how horrible things can be and how dismissive people can be with your problems. I feel alone, I feel disgusted at myself for feeling like this. I feel depressed, I feel like there's no way out. 

""The more you try to fight it, the more you try to fight it, the more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it."" ""Do not you dare surrender, do not leave me here without you cause I could never replace your perfect imperfection"".

"" . . it is very difficult for me to let other people get close to me. I am simply too afraid that they will discover that I am nothing at all, that I am nobody, a shadow, a ghost. I am afraid that they will find out that I do not have any opinion about anything, no attitudes, no ideology, that I do not know anything about anything, and suddenly they will figure out how boring I really am. ""

"" A good day is when I feel excited for the future instead of scared, when I know and believe I am loved (I always know intellectually that I am loved but I struggle to believe it on bad days), I have taken care of my hygiene and medical needs correctly, do not struggle with negative thoughts and / or lots of crying, am able to present and mindful rather than distracted by anxiety and sadness, and get at least a good chunk of my to-do list for that day finished.""

Please, enjoy your life and do not follow my steps. Again Matt, I love you ... I miss being you. 

Sincerely, Matt.",12/19/2017

I don't want to make them suffer, ever. All I want to do is overdose and drink a shit ton of alcohol and just die already, I see no future for myself and life will never be good again. I'm on Paxil, Lexapro, Seroquel and Lamictal.

Today I'm trying my best again to feel okay, although I got my meds taken away last night so I wouldn't take them all with alcohol and my mother is administrating them... She treated me like complete garbage last night, and that made me even more suicidal. I don't want to die, but it's my only way out.

I knew I shouldn't have told her but she pushed me to do it.

I don't want to kill myself today, I just want it all to end it just can't happen because every time I try to open myself up, my mother makes it all about herself and about how tired she is.

I just want to finish my career at Uni and move out, only then I'll be free. I want to be alone, I want to leave.

Hi, Mommy, I am Matthias ... I do not have many ideas for this letter but I want to assure you that it is not terminal, I'm only expressing the feelings that I have not been able to express in person because of cowardice.

You are my Mom, the person I love most in this world with my Dad, my older sister and my baby brother. My intention was never to harm them, ever. It was never looking for you to be so worried but I guess some things are inevitable ... I'm sorry so, so much, so much for what I did yesterday (suicide attempt). I do not have enough courage to tell you face to face, and I am writing this letter in digital form.

Forgive me, forgive me ... I do not know how many times I will have to apologize, maybe millions, maybe infinite times but I know that the pain or fear I caused was greater. I did not plan it to make you suffer, if you just knew the pain that causes me to think about hurting you of any kind... I am afraid of what I am becoming, I'm trying to take control of my life and although I'm not 100%  there I am taking the road to get to that.

I know I have good days where I'm excited and I really want to apologize for those days of false illusion and false happiness because in the end everything returns to pain, everything returns to fear, disappointment, disappointment, anger, anger. negativity.

I want to lean what you did to get over suffering, you are my example to follow along with my sister, you two are my example, my idols and I feel as though I am inferior, that I am an imbecile next to you. I will never meet the expectations that I know you have put on me.

I love you mom, I love you, I love you, I love you. Forgive me for yesterday, for the previous days, forgive me, forgive me. I do not know how to go back to being who I was at some point.

I beg you, please do not think it's my relationship, I forget all my problems being with him ... please, accept me mom. I never felt that you accepted me and this may sound like pointing fingers at you but at least I see it as expressing my feelings in a way that I can not do it in person because of cowardice, cowardice that invades me and believe me or not I have worked on it, but it's very difficult for me ... understand me, please.

For a couple of years I have been afraid, afraid of being left out by the people I love, I have been impulsive, I have hurt myself a couple of weeks ago and that you know, I have been obsessive, compulsive .. all that drags me on a leash full of shame.

I want to make you the happiest mother in the universe and I feel I'm not making it, I'm disappointment after disappointment and I do not have the strength to continue pretending to be well, at least not today... There are days when I wake up with full energy but those days... they will always leave, and there is nothing for now that I can do to change that, however I can assure you how much I would like to.

I do not need a strong hand, I do not need a tap on my back, I do not know what I need ... I do not know who I am, I do not know what I'm doing, I do not know what my future is, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know ... I am working as hard as I can, although sometimes it seems that I do not, because I need breaks of so much noise, so much but so much noise.

Forgive me for everything I've done, I'm making a commitment to not continue doing it but I always break it. I need to be with my Bob (my dog), I need to go out with Nick (boyfriend), I need to be able to feel normal, at least for these days.

I love you so much Mom, even if I do not say it enough.

great childhood, great family, great friends... until it all came crashing down.

parents' divorce, dad's side of the family was being fake and disgusting, ended up with only one friend and was rejected and bullied, being compared to my sister who is incredibly intelligent and I am not. My mother called me a burden, a psychotic burden, a stupid lazy burden. My father doesn't want to spend a penny on my treatment but he does it at least. Attempted suicide the other day, I'm crashing down. Not even on this sub people respond to me sometimes, I feel left out, alone. I'm afraid of boring people out and having them leave me, abandon me. 

I see no future for myself, I'm studying psychology and I don't know if I like it, all I know is that this brain fog is killing me and I want to self harm so bad right now. I won't do it.

I'm destined to commit suicide aren't I? I hurt everybody around me so why not just end it all? I'm caffeinated right now but still feel like fucking shit, shit, shit, shit. Just hit myself 5 times with my bedroom door as hard as I can. I'm not diagnosed with anything yet, I fucking hate it. I am struggling and I feel like people will never take me seriously, I have a psychiatrist appointment in 40 minutes and I am fucking over life.

only pill OD is my way, as i tried before and failed because im a **coward**

I personally have a lot of trouble getting my thoughts clear and there's just a huge fog in my mind. I kept functioning and finished the semester with good grades but I just entered autopilot mode because I felt turned off.

It feels like the world spins way too fast for you to get a hold of it, while others have it all figured out you're here trying your hardest, and people demand, demand, demand more and more and more and they expect us to get better from one day to the other and they get tired of us if we take too long to have **one fucking good day**.

Have I not been with him as much as he needs? Have not I taken his insecurities seriously? Have I talked more about myself than about him? Sorry, Nico, forgive me. I do not want to be like that, I've been like shit, break up with me please, I do not deserve you.
You tell me you feel less important or left in the background by me, who the fuck would want to be in a relationship with me then? When he told me how he felt I was playing and I managed to distract myself a bit and tried not to think so much about it but now I'm like ""shit, shit, shit"".

Feeling fake came back because I'm not lying on the floor crying for fear of abandonment, but I just know that I deserve to be abandoned by Nico, I deserve that he breaks up with me. But why should I be on the floor crying in order to not be fake?????????????????

She said that my boyfriend is promiscuous just because he's HIV Positive (undetectable) and assumed so much shit about him, she also said that he made me depressed (?????? he was the person who helped me the most next to my dad and my therapist and he was always there for me, listening to me and making me realize when I was wrong and helped me so much, so, so much). She later asked me why I've never presented him to her and I went ""because of this very same shit you're saying"".

562,anxious-wreck,0,"First off, I want to say that I'm sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** I will look for other subreddits to post this but I am trying to cover as much ground as I can to get the most opinions from actual mental health professionals and people who have been through this. Also, I of course will ask my own therapist and psychiatrist. I myself am a third year psychology student and am trying to understand what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20 years old - Male - went through what I would call an atypical depressive episode and got diagnosed with BPD on December, 2017. I've been going to therapy since April 2017 and I've worked so much to the point of distancing myself from the criteria for the Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis according to the DSM-V.

&amp;#x200B;

I took Lexapro for one year and I recently went off it (took the last pill on Saturday, September 29th). I used to take 10mg and my psychiatrist told me to lower the dosage 25% each week until I no longer took it. I've been feeling irritable the last couple of days, which has brought unnecessary arguments with my boyfriend and my family. Since two days ago I have felt anxious and agitated, to the point of laying in bed crying and tightening my body, looking for anything to calm me down but sometimes struggling to do it (yesterday I went for a walk for around 1 hour and it helped). These symptoms can come from the smallest thing and I end up taking everything to extremes, which is not fun, as you can most probably empathize with me in that, hopefully. I've read that these are common symptoms of Lexapro withdrawal and that with the correct care they will fade soon enough, but I'm curious...

&amp;#x200B;

How long does it take for the withdrawal symptoms to leave? I know it depends on each person but is there an average period of days/weeks for it to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

What are some coping mechanisms I can use when these things happen? Going for a walk helped but what can I do when I don't have the motivation to go for a walk? What can I do at home?",10/5/2018

I was studying for Uni and it's a lot, it's really a lot... I was trying my best not to freak out while studying but I failed at that and so I first started to clench my hands, I felt a bit light headed and was really frustrated and angry at myself for having a hard time at understanding what I was reading.

The thing is, I looked up and saw pins my shelf and so I immediately thought of using them on my arm to release tension, I stared at them for 5 minutes straight until I thought ""no, don't you fucking do it"", and so I didn't.

I don't want this to happen again, I don't want stress to make me do it. Will I always think about self harming when I'm that stressed?

My medication isn't helping, I took time off work to visit my great grandma in Mexico hoping it would distract me but I feel just as shitty. It's hard to keep on lying to my family saying I'm still living with my mom. They don't know how much pain she has caused, but I'm supposed to stay quiet cause 'we don't talk about that kind of stuff'. There's days where I just stay in my room all day and play sims or sleep. My grandparents are worried that I'm not happy with them but it's hard to tell them that I just don't want to live anymore.  It's nothing they did wrong... it's just how I feel.

I'm starting my senior year of high school this August and I feel completely overwhelmed. I never thought I would make it this far, and now that I'm here...alive, I've realized I had nothing planned. I have bad social anxiety and all my friends graduated this year. I don't have anyone... it sucks to see classmates out and about on a daily with friends.  I never click with people my age I guess..I had to grow up really young. I've come to the realization that I don't even know who I am. I've been depressed since as long as I could remember....I'm not normal. I don't have anything to live for...but I'm too much of a coward to attempt because of the pain I'd cause my grandparents.

611,curly_fry_queen,4,"So I've struggled with depression alot, and although my environment has changed drastically, it's hard for my mental health to improve that easily. With this being said, I can finally get to my post. I started talking to a guy I used to talk to(romantically) 3 years ago. He was a real asshole when we met, was depressed but had the mentality that he must turn his pain into anger and hurt others. We stopped talking cause he basically ghosted me but kept me on his social media. He came back recently and we started talking like nothing happened. He claimed he grew and changed for the better. I really felt like he did change, but one thing that bothered me was that he expected that I did the same. He would get upset when I wouldn't take his compliments or just couldn't see myself like the ""amazing human being"" he described me as. One night I was feeling sick so I told him I was going to bed. The next day I realized he blocked me on social media and my first reaction was to text him simply asking why. He said it was because he forgot how ""toxic negativity was"" and he wasn't ready to go back into this downward spiral. So now I'm left thinking, am I toxic? I didn't feel like I was. I don't feel like you should be upset that someone doesn't take your compliments or view themselves the same way you view them.

622,diemortalthotticus,2,"Six months ago my dad basically had a stroke that wiped out the last ten years from his memory, this also caused severe problems with PTSD, anxiety, and depression as he had an abusive childhood. 

Five months ago my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer but I don’t know what her diagnosis is because no ones telling me anything. She won’t be with us longer than a month or two from now. 

Two months ago my girlfriend of three and a half years, after slowly falling out of love with me, broke up with me. She’s told me that I’m not attractive and that I have too many problems for her to be with me. 

A month ago I tried to kill myself and spent a week in a mental hospital. While in there I learned my cousin went missing and was found dead. I also learned that learning about my suicide attempt made my dad slip into psychosis, he is no longer my dad. 

I have plans with my roommate to go to a party in two weeks. After this I plan to buy a gun and kill myself. I don’t have any hope for the future and I don’t know what to do anymore.

626,diemortalthotticus,13,"TLDR: Weed is the only medication that “works” for me and life without it doesn’t feel worth living

I’m transitioning from life as a student to life as a professional, so drug tests are on my radar now. I decided to stop smoking because lately every time I smoke I get incredibly anxious about failing a potential drug test. I’ve been a daily smoker the better part of three years because marijuana helps so much with my mental health - but I’ve always made sure that my marijuana use never affected my work or school. I stopped smoking and frankly it feels like I’m choosing between a career and being happy (or at least not feeling suicidal). Ive been getting drunk basically every night since quitting and it just doesn’t feel the same. 

I have an appointment in a month with a new psychiatrist because my old one got frustrated that several meds didn’t work and he kept trying to diagnose me with BPD because that’s his specialty (I’ve never come close to having a manic episode, have no indicators of BPD, and every other mental health professional I’ve seen has only diagnosed me with depression/anxiety). I dont know how to be okay without weed in my life and I feel like a fucking failure because of it. I don’t enjoy being alive and weed was the only real way for me to take the edge off. I dont know what to do and i dont want to bum my friends out by talking to them because they’ve heard enough of my whining. The closer i get to no longer being a student, the harder it gets not to confront the fact that i dont enjoy life, and staying sober while working 40+ hour weeks makes me more suicidal than i care to admit. How am I supposed to cope with living a life i hate while knowing that two hits is all it takes for me to forget this weight in my head? I’d rather be dead than sober, but I’m not even sure I’d rather be high than dead. I hate myself and dont know how to keep dealing with this bullshit in my head",12/23/2020

It was my college therapist who actually diagnosed me back then due to my suicidal nature and immense pressure from parents due to being gay. However, I was never prescribed any anti depressants because I made the mistake of telling them the only way I tried killing myself was overdosing. Now, whenever my new therapist reads those records they work with me to find OTC solutions or other forms of therapy which genuinely haven’t been helping out. I feel so trapped because I know I won’t overdose on anything again but I just need the meds to hit baseline. The other day I had 5HTP and A hit of Indica, and I felt baseline and I swear, every single time I hit baseline it makes me feel so jealous and envious of all of the people out there who are doing just fine and react normally to different things. Because once the high wears off it goes back down to the depths for me. I come

I'm a 20 year old female and have had depression for most of my teenage years, and thought that being in college has helped me improve since I got away from the toxic environment at home with my parents. It seems like being at home again for summer has made it even worse and I feel hopeless. I never had many friends but I'm trying to be okay with it because I don't think I can handle many friendships and like being alone, and people usually don't understand me. Yesterday the guy that I am dating came to visit me and we had a great time, and I feel like I found someone that really respects me and cares, and I felt fine till he left to go home today and now I feel depressed and alone again. I hate feeling like this and wish I could just be satisfied with things, but I feel like nothing is ever good enough for me to keep me happy. I just want to be able to have a normal life where I can be content with things and not be feeling depressed when things aren't going my way. I feel like I'm the only person that can have a great time and then feel like killing myself when I go home after it.

707,israelipita,0,"I've had mental health issues for years and to this day I can't figure out what is wrong with me. I used to think I had BPD back when I was in high school because I had some of those behaviors, but I seem to have grown out of it. I've been put in a mental hospital for teens before due to suicidal thoughts and I'm diagnosed with depression, panic disorder and trichotillomania. But I still feel like something isn't right with me. 

When people talk to me to have a conversation or I have to put thought into anything like a group project that involves coming up with ideas, I feel like my mind is just a fog. I feel like there is nothing going through my head when people talk to me. It takes me forever to do simple tasks especially school related tasks. I used to love to do things and had hobbies, but now when I try to do them and I struggle, I give up immediately. I can't make eye contact with people, and I'm basically mute at work. The only way I can communicate is by mimicking others and copying their behavior so I appear normal. I don't understand or pick up on social cues at all. I don't have many friends at all and often lose friends. People say I have a blank expression, and I have to force myself to smile all the time so people don't think I'm angry. I can't follow basic instructions and it makes people think I'm not paying attention or don't care, but I really just don't understand.

I know within the next day or so my thoughts will turn dark; thoughts of death will pop up over and over; and when the depression peaks the anxiety will kick in and do its job. The anxiety will lead again to depression and round and round it goes. 

I ended up buying a can of beer for a fried shrimp recipe I’m doing this week. Two years sober and I can feel the itch to drink it. One will lead to another and blah blah blah before you know it, I’m drinking vodka straight from the bottle.

I guess this is just my lot in life to go through these things over and over. 

Been trying different meds now over the course of this last year. They start off strong and little by little they just move in to being half affective and the doc tries something else. Most recent med change gave me suicidal thoughts like crazy I had to stop it after the first few days. 

I dunno. This is turning into a rant, but I cant keep doing this for the next fifty years of my life. Therapy helped, but after moving departments my new boss isn’t keen on letting me off to go and with limited sick time it’s not feasible. 

I’ve been telling the doc to put me on Effexor, but he keeps dodging that med for some reason. Everything I’ve read makes it seem like the winner for me. I don’t know.

Dew to some of my conditions I have almost no feeling in my hands and am in constant pain not just the mental kind....I have physical and mental pain.... along with other things....my sister totally overlooked all that....and so she was saying all that stuff about my life being perfect and I at first tried to kindly tell her that it's not perfect without getting into to much detail....she just said to me ""you just over dramatize everything. You're an attention whore. So what if you have a little numbness in ur hands so what if you have dizziness?   You're a wimp and everything you go through is basic stuff it's easy. So stop being such a wimp and stop getting offended by everything.""  I was really hurt by what she said because it's usually a lot more then just numb hands and dizziness....and I've never been able to tell her because she'll ask  me what's wrong and when i try to tell her she cuts me off after 5 seconds.... I was already depressed and am struggling to find a reason to live so her saying those things considering how close she and I were..really hurt me...    my mother said to my sister ""now now, be nice to your sister.""and my sister replied ""no, she just WANTS to get offended at everything she's to sensitive  her conditions arient that bad at all she's just over dramatic""  I felt so sad at that moment my own family never understood the constant struggle my conditions made me go through...they never understood how much pain it was....they never understood my depression ether they just call me weak...  and when my mom found out my eldest sibling raped me for 5 ish years...my mom didn't do anything she just cried that "" her daughter would do something like that"" then the next day went back to praising her eldest daughter and ignoring what she had done....I know I've always been a dramatic child but when it comes to my conditions and my depression I NEVER  over dramatized ANY of it...   I have been rather open with my family till now about my problems unlike most... I have huge need to talk it's part of my personality....but lately I stopped because I realized that if I talk they think I'm lieing...if I talk they chastise me and make me feel weak...so I've stopped talking to them...or anyone ....

It's been like a month since my birthday. And not once have they acknowledged it. They still think I'm thirteen! When I'm 14!

I live an unusual life per say... quite unbelievable  so when I tell  someone...they usually think that I'm lieing, don't get me wrong it's nothing magical or to bizarre it just seems like a whole bunch of unlikely things that are to hard to believe.  Over time I hid those things to myself and my family  and didn't tell people so that they wouldn't leave me. I made the mistake of finally letting someone in... I didn't know him long but I felt as if I could trust him he was sweet and kind and he was just all around amazing friend.  I told him bits and pieces and I don't know if it came out wrong or if...I don't know.... I thought everything was fine between us until one week I told him I was going to be busy and he exploded. He said things like ""can you just stop lieing to me?, can you just be real?""  I'm sitting here today trying to get those words out of my head. All I want to do is show him I never lied and even though I understand why he doesn't believe me, it doesn't mean that being called a lier by the person who helped you through hard times doesn't hurt immensely. I know that logically he was the one lieing to me... because all those things he said to me...he never meant. Every time he told me he cared, everytime he told me I wasn't worthless every single time he ever encouraged me...he meant none of it....none...  now that he's gone I realize how much he helped me get through it all. He was my only friend...he promised me he'd never leave and he left in the dust.  I don't know how 1 person can hurt me so much... but he was all I had... my life has always been going downhill and i feel like a piece of trash.

805,paladin_omega78,3,"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression a few months before and whatever I've tried, it has gotten worse. Had an interview call from a company I really wanted to join in London, but after the interview I gave, almost no hopes of a call back. Adding to that, a recent breakup (had a 2 year relationship with a girl I thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with), football team sucking balls as usual, parental pressure, etc. etc.   


All I'm asking for is a suggestion to feel ""better"". Be it any music, some form of self-help, anything. I dunno if this is the right sub to post this in but I'm almost at breaking point and would welcome positivity in any form whatsoever. Thank you.",5/20/2019
806,paladin_omega78,2,"Self-explanatory I guess. I'm just venting here, dunno what else to do. Graduated from a top-20 university last year, thought it'll finally get better. Quite the opposite, in fact. Had a pretty messy breakup with a girl who I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with, worked in a startup for a bit but absolutely hated it, so left and came back home to London. Living with parents is so much worse than I initially thought. Ended up going to therapy but that didn't help either.

And lo and behold, when things were finally starting to look up, woke up today to find two reject mails. One of them from a company which gave me a fucking 6-hour long coding test to complete and then THIS.

Football used to be the only thing I looked forward to, but Man United too has very disappointing for a while now.

A year later, I've been getting rejects after rejects while applying to full-time offers. Each day I try to wake up with some positivity, checking my mails for **ONE** response. But not to be. I think it's me, not them.   
Do you guys sometimes feel that too? Depression has a funny way of gnawing away at the little hope left. Hope gives rise to despair, so maybe we shouldn't hope at all. But the mind still clings on to strands doesn't it? 

So I post here again. You guys were with me through the pain and sorrow, it sometimes feels like I've actually got people who care and still believe in me even if my own parents don't. Thank you, for that.

Life hasn't really improved after that though with both professional and personal failures happening, I've learnt the value of staying alive. There's so much of the world to be witnessed, so many people to prove wrong, so many things to accomplish for myself. I have resolved to be happy, or atleast try.

2019 was quite simply, the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with clinical depression late 2017, but the problems surmounted the past year. Came back home after graduating with a Masters, thought things would finally change. But..bad breakup with the love of my life, unemployment and repeated repeated rejections, problems at home, had a ligament tear....it goes on and on. Wanted to start afresh the new decade, but it just plummeted lower and lower. Interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still haven't been gotten back to, so I think that's that- my last chance at some redemption is gone, im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment. Been shutting myself off everything, but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going. We were on the terrace smoking a fag, and at a time it was only me there. Then all the pent-up frustration let loose. All the failures had taken a toll, and I broke down. Went to the edge, said some words and was just ABOUT to jump when I saw something flash by me. A white trail of light. Wasn't a bird, or paper, or anything. My mind became even more blank but instead of jumping,  I staggered back and fell back on the floor. 

I am a man of science and am not supersititous but it just felt like a sign. To not give up, keep going. However the world keeps kicking me down. I still dont know why I didn't jump. Not that anything's better now, but dunno, just felt like this isn't the time.

I’m 22(f), diagnosed with severe depression 2 years ago, among a few other illnesses. Things have always been a struggle but as of lately they just feel unmanageable. I hit that point that I was always afraid of hitting...the one where I don’t have the energy to try anymore. I’m tired of feeling like a battery that’s constantly at 2%. I’m tired of feeling like I’m sleepwalking through each day until the days don’t even feel numbered anymore. I have no concept of time - it’s all just when I sleep, when I wake up and when I go back to sleep. That’s how I make the distinction between one day and the next. I can’t do that for the rest of god knows how long. When things are good, they really are good. But when they’re bad, they’re fucking awful. I either can’t feel any emotion for days at a time, or I feel every single thing all at once. When I cry, I sob until my voice is hoarse and my stomach muscles hurt from clenching. I’m exhausted, I’m drained, I have nothing left in me. Is this what it means to live? Having to fight just to make it through another day? And where is the reward in that? Because the next day is the same. I’m an empath - I know there’s people out there who are suffering ten thousand times more than I am. And that alone breaks my heart. I think that’s partly why I keep this all to myself...I know life has dealt a shitty hand to others, as well. I’m not trying to make my pain the focus. I’m not trying to put my needs at the forefront of everyone’s priorities. I’m just in such a deep-rooted sadness, hollowness, defeat.. I don’t know how much longer I can continue.

I'm 19 years old and have been struggling with depression for 3 years, it gets better, then it gets bad again. These past 8 months have been the hardest. I was diagnosed as bipolar and I was suicidal and dangerously depressed until about March, when things started looking up, yet of course shit had to hit the fan again. Since then Ive had some good days sprinkled in with excruciating ones. I even went inpatient in April because I was not sleeping or eating, and entering insomnia induced psychosis. I was told I was not bipolar and had major depressive disorder. After I left inpatient I had a really good three weeks, but it's getting hard again.

I have hobbies (reading, coloring, painting, TV, etc.) and I fill my days from sun up to sun down distracting myself so the depression doesn't swallow me whole. I eat relatively healthy and exercise everyday. I've gotten my sleep under control and have been sleeping well for the past month. I've been on Effexor since I was 16 and recently my new psychiatrist has decided to taper me off and start me on Lexpro and continue my Zyprexa and Trazadone.

898,sparkledstar23,0,"I am seriously considering finding a new psychiatrist.

I am a 20-year-old female, approximately 5'6, and 130 pounds. I am currently taking 100mg Pristiq. I use an e-cigarette daily, but not excessively.

A brief history: I was diagnosed with depression and general anxiety when I was 16 and prescribed Effexor by my PCP. Everything was fine until I had a really bad winter 2018 and decided it was time for an actual psychiatrist to manage my medication. That psychiatrist misdiagnosed me and I went through 11 medications in 4 months, before I ended up in the psych ward. I had been sleeping (or not sleeping, I guess) about 3 hours every 3-4 days. When I was admitted I had psychotic features due to lack of sleep for 3+ months. It was horrible. I tried everything to sleep: melatonin, Benadryl, Nyquil, even weed. That psychiatrist tried a slue of antipsychotics (for the sedation) and nothing worked. When I was discharged, I dropped the psychiatrist and found a new one. I have been with him since May 2019. He has since changed my meds from Lexapro to Prozac and finally Pristiq (which is working, yay!)

But one thing has stayed consistent: sleeping problems. Not one drug has given me a good night's sleep, except occasional marijuana, but he does not approve of the use of weed. I practice great sleep hygiene and try to do as much as I can to sleep. I have complained about this problem since the first appointment I had. Since last May I have gotten my depression and anxiety figured out.

I emphasize the sleep problems every single appointment and message, yet the only answer I have received from him is ""We will check back in 2-4 weeks and see"" or ""I'd like to see in a couple weeks."" Every 2-4 weeks I message or have an appointment (which is getting extremely expensive) and it is the same response every single time.

I'm not sure if he thinks I just want pills or am not doing all that I can, but I would expect after 14 months of continuous complaints and problems, he would be doing something to help. He also knows my history with sleep and how it landed me in the psych ward. I am getting about 3-5 hours of sleep a night with the occasional all-nighter. At this point, marijuana doesn't even help.

I want to know if this is normal. I have friends who's psychiatrists will prescribe them things the second a problem is brought up. I am hesitant to find a new psychiatrist because of my horrible experience with the first, but it is getting to the point where I am questioning why he has refused to do much about it.

I really like my current psychiatrist as he has helped me immensely with my depression and anxiety, but I am so curious why he has not offered any solutions? Any help or advice is welcome.",7/4/2020
905,taddysad,0,"Weeks ago, I was having so many thoughts of harming others and myself. Everything looked bleak. I hated myself for feeling the way I felt and for the thoughts I was having. I knew something was wrong.

Two weeks ago, I felt what the book described as derealization. I was moving because I knew had to, but my soul was gone. I couldn't feel anything and my heart was empty. Sadness didn't bother me as much anymore, it's become a part of me. Roads seem longer than they should and I can't help but wish an accident will happen everytime I cross the road.

A week ago, I started waking up in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason. It can get as bad as waking up every hour. Eventually I gave up on going back to sleep.

Now, I'm don't feel anything. Or at least I like to think that. When I'm around people I subconsciously put on a smile. I actually feel happy in the moment but deep inside the sadness washes over me instantly. When I'm alone, I'm a bag of despair and sadness. I can cry my eyes out, take 10, come out with smiles and laughs like nothing happen. Am I a world class actor or a total train wreck?

I've seen psychologists and psychiatrist since then. Some helped but can't anymore, some try to but can't really relate, some are total jackass and needs to be put down.

919,taddysad,0,"Months ago i was going through a difficult time, which worsen when i tried to seek help with an unforgiving psychiatrist. Filled with doubt and anxiety, but with the advice of kind souls, I met another professional who listened and diagnosed me. With his help I felt like i was getting better. That is until recently when our sessions were less than a min with nothing but prescriptions and repetitive questions.
I woke up today on the wrong side of the bed, had to throw everything i had to bypass the noise in my head and drag my numb body out of the house to appear for today's appointment. The trip was long, and it felt longer with the world crashing down in my head.

Music kept me numb and going, until luck ran out. The wire shorted out. I desperately twisted it to at least get the white noise on one side, telling myself that i will find relief once i reach my destination.

The wait was short today. My number was called within minutes as i sat down. Pushing the door open, i forced a slight smile yet hoping that he can see past it, he never once did. Today was different, i felt worse than any day in months. I took the initiative to tell him the feelings bottled within me, in an annoyed and irritated tone, in hopes that he can related and help. He said there was nothing he could do to help, and that he found me rude, then proceding to threaten to cancel his usual prescription. 

My heart sank. This was a professional, someone who had in the past helped me tide through one of the most difficult times in my life, and here we are today. I blatantly told him to go ahead with his intention and he did what all prideful people did in his line of work. I held back my tears as he wrapped the session up.


Walking away, i reflected hard. Perhaps I shouldn't have forced my troubles on him. Why should he care? I was just another one of his patients. Although, i was somewhat glad that it was over. I can finally close the chapter instead of clinging to false hope every month that things will get better with his help. Still, i wanted to thank him for his help in the past. not sure whether i would but i should.

I try to be cheery and do have real things to look  forward to, I'm looking forward to having a partner, moving in with someone and getting a shit ton of cats. I tend to joke a lot as a way to cope a guess. When I go to therapy I literally laugh as I'm talking about how I constantly have suicidal thoughts and am so depressed I just lay on the floor. My therapist has told me that it makes it difficult for her to imagine me doing those things because of how happy I seem, so she has to try to ignore the emotions I'm actually showing to get an accurate depiction of what is actually going on. I dont think this is a mask I'm putting on, I think I'm just so scared of being vulnerable that I glued a smile on me that I cant take off. I wish I could actually act sad in front others so I could be taken seriously. 

I'm just too good at hiding my emotions that no one will even notice anything is wrong until I'm in such a deep depression where I physically cant smile. I have trouble asking for help, so I wish I could act a bit sad so someone could reach out to me. Can anyone relate? Is anyone just a genuinely cheery person bit still depressed.

939,throwaway755403,7,"Title says everything. I'll put a tl:dr at the end

Today is my 17th birthday. I recently got diagnosed with depression and have been very depressed for the last month. I knew today I would just as depressed but I hoped that I would enjoy this day a bit, so I'm not as depressed as usual. Clearly that didnt happen.
I woke up in the morning just like I do every day. I went to the kitchen after getting dressed and my family gave me a card this looked pretty cool. Then I saw my one present. A vacuum. A portable one actually. I had been needing one to clean after my pet but I didnt really think I would get it as my only birthday gift. It wasnt wrapped, just in the normal packaging it came in. Just a normal, mediocre vacuum. Then I went to school and just kept thinking about my present. I was looking forward to something that would make me happy. I watch some shows and shit and was expecting some sort of gift relating to that. Hell maybe even some money. This vacuum was not something that made me remotely happy. What 17 year old wants a vacuum? I feel selfish saying this but when put on top of my general depression, I just felt like utter, unloved shit. 
I got a couple happy birthdays from my friends over text, only one from my closest friend in person (I had told her I would he depressed so she was being amazing to me, she was the best part of my day)
I went home for lunch, made myself some food and just sat and ate it in silence. Then I went to my room and cried. I was so depressed. I was still waiting on a text from another close friend, but it never came. 
I came back to school to hang out with friends before my next class. Only 2 of them were there (one of them isnt even my friend). Finally another 2 friends came. One of them was one of my closer friends (the one who hadn't texted yet). He immediately took out his switch and started playing smash with 2 of the other guys. I was totally ignored. 
Then finally after my second last class he told me happy birthday after my closest friend told me the 5th time today (not a bad thing at all). 
After school I hung out with her again and then went home. At home my mom told me to open my vacuum and I told her I was going for something more gift like. She said she was sorry for ruining my birthday and that she was planning on giving me money too. Then I went to my room again and cried for an hour. 
Later my dad got home 30 mins later than expected with some flowers and chocolate.  It was very clear my mom texted him to buy me something last minute. 
Then we went to my fave restaurant, that was actually nice. On the way back I got into an argument with my dad. Once we got home I went to my room and haven't left since.

I feel super selfish but I just expected a bit more. I wanted something more fun. I wanted a cake and I wanted more than 2 friends to acknowledge my existence. 

Btw my mom texted me this 
""Ok. I'm off to bed. Happy Bday once again and sorry we screw it up for you a little. Love u!"" 
The a little kinda hurts because this has been my worst say all month. 

Tl:dr
17th birthday, got a portable vacuum and nothing else. Felt like shit all day. Some friends didn't seem to acknowledge me. I just wanted one day where everything went right, but obviously I'm unlucky.

940,throwaway755403,1,"So I made a post on r/offmychest 2 days ago that explains the whole situation. Basically my friend (f) tried to kiss me (gay m) multiple times without my consent and and it made me uncomfortable. She knew I felt uncomfortable because I literally told her I was uncomfortable and that I'd like her to stop. Later that day she also told me she was sorry and tried to cover her actions with the excuse that she has a lot of emotions and she had to let them out on someone. 

I felt pretty used and have been thinking about it a lot. We texted today after my friend let her know both me and other people who faced a similar thing to me were uncomfortable. She apologized and we talked about everything for a bit, she did kinda try and shame and guilt me but we ended up talking about it better. Then she admitted that she tends to use me sometimes and I told her to avoid doing that basically. 

Now that I know for a fact that I was used I feel worthless. I'm a pretty passive guy and it's easy to take advantage of me but I always play it off but this made me think about it more seriously. Because I'm so ""chill"" she felt like it was ok to be affectionate with me and I wasn't even taken seriously when I said no because, well idk why. Like I feel like other people are gonna keep using me now and theres nothing I can do about it, I kinda feel like a toy. 

I've recently gotten out of a major, very long depressive episode (4 or 5 months long I think?). Ever since then I've been doing really well actually.  My life has been going to shit with basically all my dreams collapsing but I've managed to keep going and I've been super proud of myself but this has kinda put me in a rut. I can't seem to move on from this, probably because it's not a temporary problem and there is no real solution to it. I dont wsnt to be depressed again but it seems like that's what's going to happen and I'm not ready.

941,throwaway755403,2,"I say normal because depression itself isnt exactly normal lol. I'm more curious if this is an actual symptom of depression or something I should probably worry about. Btw I've been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety. 

So basically I'll have moments when I get really overwhelmed by my thoughts and my thoughts just start yelling at me. But it feels like a separate person but they have my voice kinda? The yelling can continue for a decent amount of time and normally it gets bad enough that I cant function and have a little meltdown I guess. I tend to wanna yell too. I just kinda feel like yelling, everything moves really fast yet slow and I kinda anxiously shake my leg. The thing is from the outside I look pretty ok, just zone out I guess, I dont really do anything but inside my head its insanely chaotic. This only happens when I'm having a depressive episode and I haven't noticed a real trend in frequency or triggers.

I actually having one right now. It's kinda calmed down and I can tell I'm being yelled at but I'm not really actually hearing anything if that makes sense. I do want it to stop tho because its extremely distressing.

942,throwaway755403,2,"Ok maybe kinda dramatic but it hasn't been too great

Literally nothing this year has really gone way. The only good thing is that I got a major surgery that improved my quality of life, but that's one of those things that you know is going to happen. I did wait a whole year and paid $2000 so imo it doesnt have as big of an impact as working towards something and getting rewarded.

Speaking of working towards things, I spend the whole year working on my portfolio for college. It's a very comparative program and I put all my time and energy into making the best art I could. I was insanely stressed and half way through that year I had a giant, 4 or more month depressive episode that i managed to chug through somehow. And yet after all that I didnt get in and actually got an insanely low score. So I have to take a gap year and try again (which was my plan b, I just really believed that I would be able to get in). So now I have to endure another year of being under an ungodly amount of stress, toy demolishing any remaining mental health I have left. Oh and since I didnt get in, i won't be moving away from my parent so I'm stuck living in my dysfunction family that only amplifies my depression. The only positive is that all my pets are there and if I moved I wouldn't be able to take them with me, at least not for first year. Also since all my friends are going to post secondary, I'm stuck in my town all alone. Most of my friends are going places really far and wont be able to visit often. I've found myself suddenly drifting away from my friends so I'm not even sure I'll have any close friends to hang out with anyway. Right now I don't think I have a  actual support system. I had a therapist for a while but when I got out of a depressive episode I stopped going to her and now that I've started another one, I'm too scared to come back to not disappoint her. Plus my parents believe that since I'm not in therapy anymore it must mean I'm fine and i don't want them to know that just because I went to therapy for 6 months then stopped doesnt mean I'm cured. And it's also expensive. My one friend that I could vent to is kinda not talking to me anymore. I have no idea why but now it seems like I lost my closet friendship of my life and got replaced by her boyfriend which makes me feel even more worthless. 

I've just been so depressed. I was able to sleep for 13 hours one night which is a bit worrying. My grades are starting to slip (I'm a 90s/high 80s student too). I can feel myself giving up but no one seems to catch on. According to my psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression in November, I've had it undiagnosed for 4 years prior and honesly i just dont see it going away. Idk how I'm supposed to keep living and staying motivated if everything is going wrong. The worst is that I cant even talk to anyone outside the internet.

I recently found out about all of this after college and have been coping with it but it seems like the more that I’m aware of it, the worse it’s been getting. 

I’ve been on Zoloft for a year now, it was working great until I stupidly decided to go off of it for a couple weeks and then I tried to OD on my remaining prescription (45 days worth of 50mg tablets). I was put on a 51/50 evaluation hold a couple weeks ago. 

I feel even worse now, I’m back on my Zoloft and I don’t know if it hasn’t kicked in yet or what, but I feel so depressed and my relationship is crumbling and I feel like there’s nothing I can do and I’m once again fighting the urge to self harm and pushing away suicidal thoughts. I’ve turned to nearly chain smoking and other drugs to alleviate some of the unpleasantness, but I know this isn’t sustainable; not that it helps really. 

The therapist told me for some people that depression isn’t a phase or a reactive mood to a major traumatic event, but it’s a personality trait; it’s a part of me. I can’t imagine living my entire life feeling this way. It just gets worse as I get older. 

Any advice? As vague as it may be, all is welcomed.",6/29/2019

I never have, for as long as I can remember even in middle school, had ambition, I never felt the need to excel at anything or do anything more than I had to—I simply wanted to just survive day by day. I never made a lot of friends, I preferred to just stay at home with my dad and watch movie, even all through high school. 

I have plenty of opportunity and resources, but I can’t find the drive to do more than I have to. And not only that, I just hate life. I hate doing things, I hate people, I hate myself. I was involuntarily checked into a psych ward not too long ago for an attempt at suicide—I thought being in there would make me appreciate the outside world more—but ever since I got out, I’ve been struggling to exist even more than before. I’m back on my meds (Zoloft), but they don’t seem to be working as well as they did before I tried to OD on them.

972,versacek9,0,"Sometimes when I get upset, I’ll get high and it’s like my problems don’t matter anymore and I can change my mindset and move on with my day. 

Other times it doesn’t have an effect and I’m just high and sad. I don’t like sitting with these feelings, I hate that I can’t get rid of them myself and I relay on my boyfriend to fix me, but that’s not fair and I can tell he doesn’t want to deal with it. 

I want the feeling to go away so I can be productive and have an appetite, but fuck I feel so numb and heavy inside. 

Yesterday my coworkers really wanted me to come out and hang out with them on our off day, I really wasn’t in the mood to socialize. They’re good friends, but I just didn’t have the energy. All day they were texting and calling me, but I ghosted them. Then they contacted my boyfriend and asked if they could come through—he loves to socialize and I said fine, whatever since I felt bad for bailing on them. 

I don’t really love having people in my house, but they’re trusted friends. Of course they brought people they didn’t tell me about, but I sucked it up and was a good sport. They even invited more people that they didn’t run by me, but whatever, I wasn’t trying to be a party pooper. 

They wanted to keep the party going, I was obviously burnt out on people and one of my friends noticed that and said they should dip to his house. I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if I winded downed for a bit before we joined them, he said sure. 

My friends started texting and calling me again begging me to come over, so I reluctantly agree because my boyfriend wants to socialize and my friends wanted to see me. I was so tired when I got to the other house, I asked a guy who lived there if I could sleep in his bed because I didn’t want to socialize, but I didn’t want to ruin my boyfriend’s fun. 

When they woke me up at 3 to go home, I was relieved. Prior to going out, I asked if we could leave the party at 3 and my boyfriend agreed. Turns out he invited all my coworkers to come back to our house without running it by me. I was so upset, it was so obvious that I didn’t want to socialize and I was making an effort and it felt like no one cared.

973,versacek9,1,"TL;DR at bottom. Sorry for the novel. Important question at bottom, if you care to weigh in. 

So I’ve [25F] been diagnosed with chronic depression and general/social anxiety, apparently I’ve had it since my childhood (real ugly divorce paired nicely with years long bullying) and I wasn’t aware until college and it eventually worsened to a breaking point when my house got robbed. 

Originally, I was put on Celexa and while it helped me cope and stopped my disproportioned rage fits, I didn’t enjoy the numbness so I eventually went off of it. 

Over time my “condition” started to have a negative impact on my relationship. Not wanting to lose him and realizing I wasn’t the only one suffering, I saw a psychiatrist and so for the last year I’ve been on Zoloft. It’s really really helped. Initially, I started with 50mg; I definitely felt less on edge and more in control of my emotions, but the side effects of weight gain, complete lack of motivation, and loss of libido hit me pretty hard. 

After discussing the side effects, I was prescribed Wellbutrin and almost immediately I felt better. I had more energy, I was generally more pleasant to be around—not just a lump on the couch—and, to my boyfriend’s delight, I got my figure back and I was horny on the daily. I eventually needed to up my Zoloft dosage to 100mg (I started to get the rage fits again) and I finally felt alleviated of most of my unpleasant thoughts, my obsessions with cleanliness (I was deep cleaning the sink, shower, and countertops every time I used them), and best of all—caring what other people think. I think the ‘not giving a fuck’ effect of Zoloft with the ‘I’m feeling good today’ of Wellbutrin was exactly what I needed. 

Everything seems great and fine in dandyland, right? Nope. My firefighter brother [27M]—recently married and father of my adorable 6 month old niece—just got diagnosed with colon cancer and my dad—my best friend in the entire universe, who just survived prostate cancer—had a stroke last week. 

Obviously, I’m absolutely crushed, but due to the mood stabilizer I bounce back to being indifferent/pleasant pretty quickly. This in turn makes me feel extraordinarily guilty for not making enough of an effort to visit dad—I was at an off-site work event when my step-mom called me, I couldn’t exactly break down when promoting my job, but thinking back WHY THE FUCK didn’t I stop what I was doing and rush to the hospital? He was like 20mins away. It didn’t even occur to me, I was literally drinking mimosas at a golf course. I still haven’t gone to see him, which makes me feel like a shit daughter—I’m scared to see him struggling with his words, it’s heartbreaking, he’s a knowledge-obsessed engineer and to imagine him having to read books outloud and having difficultly pronouncing the words... On top of this, I feel immense guilt for my brother, who is the kindest, most honest, do-gooder I’ve ever met and just started his cute, perfect little life. Me, on the other hand—suicidal, occasional/frequent drug user, unmarried, no kids, and I don’t yet have a career, heck I don’t even have (or ever owned) a credit card that’s how little fucks I give. I’m luckily/unjustly spoiled by my amazing, intelligent, wealthy boyfriend [26M], I really don’t have to worry too hard about bills, while my brother risks his life on a weekly basis. 

This has all happened with a month of each other—the Zoloft uppage, the cancer, and the stroke—and for the most part I still feel in control of my emotions. 

I’ve always partook in the occasional, recreational, social drug usage—weed, cocaine, adderall—but I never had much reliance on any of the substances and used them as responsibly as a 20-something drug user can. However, today I snapped at my boyfriend and broke down in sobbing tears because he had a bad day (car problems) and he wouldn’t engage with me, wasn’t being pleasant to me. Not mean, but not kind; he told he didn’t like how much I was talking and that I talked his ear off last night about things he didn’t care about—I took this to mean that he didn’t want to listen, talk or acknowledge my feelings of any kind so I snapped, because up until then I had been having a nice day and I didn’t feel I deserved this treatment. 

The entire time I was just trying to communicate to him that I wish he’d literally just be nice to me, that’s all I want, or at least humor my conversation—I just talk about my job and since I actively listened to his boring software talk for years, you’d think he’d throw me a bone. 

Eventually, it was worked out that: 
A) I’m becoming more and more reliant on drugs (particularly cocaine) to escape my feelings, 
B) I talked about my job a lot because I’m highly valued and appreciated there and it makes me feel good, 
C) being heard is important to me because I feel like I can’t talk to my brother to feel better (he’s the one who’s ill) and I can’t with my Dad either, who was always my knight in shining armor, but I have to come to terms that he can’t save me anymore—he needs it more, and finally and most importantly, 
D) my boyfriend is allowed to have a bad day and I need to learn how to respect that.

Overall, I’m having a hard time entertaining the possibility that if I feel this bad on a recently doubled dosage of Zoloft and I’ve been suicidal before, (did I mention I was thrown in the looney bin on an involuntary 3-day hold for trying to OD on ‘ironically’ Zoloft, but I had gone off it cold turkey a few weeks prior for fear of the possible effects of mixing with coke so my head wasn’t in the best place) if I were completely clean I think I would have already killed myself. 

If you’ve made it this far, bless your soul, child. I started writing this at 4:48 and now it’s 5:53 yikes. 

****************************

*ANYWAYS*

What I’m getting at is—*how bad am I harming my health by mixing cocaine and my prescription meds frequently?*

I probably do a half gram a day with maaaaybe a two/three day break, and on some days I’ll pop an addy after binging on blow all night, then go straight to work for 8hrs and then come home and do a line or two or three to have some form of dopamine release. Then I’ll get high with dabs and/or vapes until I fall asleep. 

*TL;DR*
As good as I feel on Zoloft, sudden and extremely unfortunate events (brother has cancer and dad had stroke all within a month) have triggered my depression (rage + ST) again. It’s terrifying to think about how I might have felt if I wasn’t taking any medication—I genuinely don’t think I would have been able to process that information and live with my emotions.

Now, I realized from a very long time ago that nobody really cares. This isn't a new thing. But I think the true emotional part of that realization did. I'm gonna go out and say it, I have no friends. None. Sure, maybe mutrals that I've talked to a couple times, but not somebody who I can share interests, tell them what's been bothering me and getting a reassurance from a familiar face. And I'm just going to say. Loneliness is one of the worst feelings I have ever felt in my life.

\(Note, IRL friends are blown out the window. I just graduated from school and my best and only friend near the end of senior year didn't even really acknowledge me near the end. I don't consider them a friend anymore because I barely talked to them due to severe anxiety, which sucks ass.\)

So, I'm active online and that's where I talk to most people. And even then, I don't have anybody. I have followers, sure, but in some way they are too intimidated to talk to me? I don't know. I'll try and act like everybody else does and over exaggerate my interests and personality in order to try and at least get a little attention and find some relationship, but nobody cares.

Then, I ask myself. Why? What am I doing wrong? I've been with these people for months, trying to support them all I can and just trying. But I'm still considered just a person? This is what infuriates me. Not the not having anybody part, but being so god damn lonesome and starved of attention that I have to throw a god damn pity party for myself everytime I have to type one of these out.

Nobody cares. Nobody cares.

I don't care.

You shouldn't have to care, and it's your choice not to care and I'm fine with that.

But, it hurts.

It hurts knowing that you are just another face in a cesspool and no matter how hard you'll try to be something more, you're really not.

It's scary to think that if I died and I never posted on anything again, nobody would miss me.

Nobody would think, hey what happened to that guy?

It hurts and it's terrifying and pathetic.

I just wish someone cared. I wish I had that one person who I could always go to and not have it be some random dude who's also feeling like a shit.

And, I should be ashamed that I want people to care, because society would mold a big ass label on me saying ""ATTENTION WHORE""  
Am I wrong?  
Am I really a bad person because I just want to feel something? Feel loved? Feel fucking appreciated and feeling like people actually would want me around?

I'll be dead honest. I want someone to care. I want someone to focus on me. That's my truest feeling and society has bashed that to the fucking ground. If you want someone to care? Attention fucking whore. Nobody should care about you or your problems. Because you don't care.

That's the mentality. I'm so fucking sick of it.

I'm just going to end it here because I'm just tired. Borderline, I'm a lonely fuck who's got nobody. Nobody really wants me around and if I was sad or gone for a little while? Nobody would care unless I said ""oh \*cough cough\* guys im sad"" and then they'd come rushing to my every need and then leaving and so on. My truest feeling is to be loved but I self\-loathe my existence for even thinking about needing the urge for someone to give me a passing glance.

I think this is also why I envy popular people, they'll say they feel a little disappointed and their millions of adoring caring fans will flush them with love and acceptance and great empathy. I would love that. But of course, that's just another stupid dream.

I'm not this.

This is not me.

I feel like I regressed SO FUCKING MUCH in the past few days. Every time I see my friends I feel a sense of hostility. Anger. Jealously. Depression. Anxiety.

These emotions are so extreme.

I want to literally scream out all my frustrations into this paragraph and make it caps letters but, that'd just look pathetic enough than this vent already is.

And that felt good to type out.

How do I feel about this now?

Depressed.

Tired.

I don't know what to do.

Who to turn to because frankly, I have nobody to turn to.

I don't want to dump my aggressive problems on anybody.

Yet I've been there for the people who I want to cry to.

Conflicted.

All I feel is I just want to feel ok again.

I feel like a baby screaming a tantrum.",8/18/2018
1000,vvvrrrttt,0,"Hi. I'm just going to start off by saying that I've only just become a freshman in high school, and I'm aware my problems can just be me coming off as a hormonal emotional teenager complaining. But I never have anywhere to truly vent except for here, as of now. This is more of me just typing down thoughts physically. I would write, or talk to someone, but writing for me is too slow to quickly get thoughts down before I either forget about them or I'm not frustrated anymore. And on the fact that people irl could literally track them down and destroy literally the last remaining piece of privacy I have, by exposing what I think and then probably confronting me about it. And about the talking part, as of now, I barely have anyone to talk to anymore. I do have a therapist, but I only go see them about every other two weeks. I only have about an hour session with them anyway but I can't ever get every single thing that is bugging the fuck out of me out of my mouth in a short timeframe like that.

But yes. Other than that one person, I don't have anybody else. I am uncomfortable talking to my family and I have probably only one irl friend at the moment who I barely even talk to anymore. I did have a lot of friends over the past summer. Except, they were on Discord and probably the only people I could ever talk to or relate to. But, my mom is overprotective, so she had taken my phone away because she found out I even had that. She found out I told my friend about me self harming and talking about other unrelated stuff. She also had tracked my other social media, scowering through everything. I had absolutely no privacy. And still don't. I understand why.

Because apparently all people on the internet, are pedophiles who cannot help you. In under any circumstances. 

This is going off track of the main problem I was venting about, but it takes factor in why I really, really want to give up right now. For one, I'm failing. Two D's, two F's, three C's, and a B in my easiest class. I'm failing. Very obviously. I have had literally a straight F these past three months of school in math. My mom threatens to put me in some sort of special needs school if I'm like this and I don't blame her. And it seems like something is happening soon, anyway.

I'm so frustrated with myself, because I'm such a fucking lazy dumbass. All I do when I get home, is just sit. Mindlessly watching TV. Every single fucking day. Doing nothing. Not even trying. I don't try to go see that friend I talked about earlier. I don't try.

And about the dumbass thing, I don't know what's wrong with me. I go to tutoring every Monday. The teacher will literally one-on-one teach me what to do. And I understand. But guess what?

I forget probably everything a few days or hell, even the day afterwards. Everything. I have failed every single math test I received these three months. Even right now. Right fucking now I'm trying to do an easy assignment that is of course, late. But I can't. I forgot everything and I don't know how. And still. I'm distracted. I'm distracted because I have to just vent and waste time.

I'm lazy. And it's even more of a fucking joke that I know I'm lazy yet do nothing more to try. There are so many fucking more problems. I miss talking to the only friends I had. But I still fucking can't do that. I have nobody right now. I'm extremely bitter towards people. I get so annoyed and fucking frustrated with everyone in my family so it comes off that I hate them. I have acquaintances at school, but that's it.

I'm just a extremely lonely, angry, dumbass that is literally just failing. 

...A few months back, so many people were encouraging me to just get help. I did. I told my mom one day that I was depressed and I did want help. I did get diagnosed eventually. I did go on pills. I do go to therapy. 

...But. I honestly, *honestly,* don't know if I was happier before I revealed my problem or not. I feel. So, *so* vulnerable to people. My family. Teachers. Doctors and all that shit. I hate it. My exact fear has kind of come true. I didn't tell anyone for so long because I was scared people would treat me differently.

And from now, it honestly happened. 

A couple weeks ago, my mom was furious that I was failing, basically screaming at me and all that shit. I don't blame her. But in the moment, I had a breakdown. I just wanted it all to stop and just to stop screaming. I screamed back, acting crazy. Revealing shit and getting angry. My grandma was with her and screamed back at me. She said that I should just get sent to a boot camp and literally saying to my mom that I was just mentally ill and that I couldn't be helped. She said that right in my face to my mom like I wasn't even there.

And I was just thinking. If I never told anyone, would they even use my vulnerabilities against me? Ever since my mom found out that I have internet friends and that I told them stuff, I was texting someone from her phone. Found out she had literally shared my private talks to that friend. She shared screenshots with my dad's grandma. I asked her if she shared it with anyone else.

She said no. And you know what. She shared it with her mom. She fucking lied to me and now my family knows *everything.* *I'm. Fucking. Vulnerable.* They WILL fucking use that shit *against* me. That's the whole fucking reason why when we were fighting, my grandma had even brought it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even remember if I was happier then or now. Maybe if I never spoke up, nobody would know. But that's just dumb, I know that. Because obviously something is wrong with me. Even just saying that is so fucking dehumanizing. 

Honestly, at this point I just want to do something crazy just to prove everyone's suspicions that I'm the black sheep of the family. Just embracing failure at this point. But again, I'm too much of a pussy to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

This was a long post. I still probably have things to say but... yeah. If you read through this... just thanks. I have a clusterfuck of thoughts right now. But yeah. I kind of just went off with whatever. I don't know how to end shit like this, but mm.",11/6/2018
1001,vvvrrrttt,1,"Hi, Reddit. I'll just cut to the chase.

I'm currently 15, having an, in-my-opinion, shitty relationship with my family. I've been medically diagnosed with ADHD with an onslaught of also depression and anxiety through the past 2 years and currently on medication and counselling.

Yesterday I found out by my parents' screaming that my dad is very likely going to jail for DUI. My mom told him she refuses to give any money whatsoever to get a lawyer and told him to call his family. It's also unlikely they'll do anything. My dad is an alcoholic and has been smoking since he was 13. I believe he is abusive, though for me it is hard to tell so. If I could recount events that he did without the illusion that he is my dad than maybe I could come to that conclusion very easily. But I can't. Because my brain still tells me he's my dad. But I will say he has done many things over the years.

He did used to spank me as a little kid. How much he did I can't remember but it happened. In our old house one night me and my siblings and my mom came home at night and he had guns laying out in the living room and my mom just went downstairs and saw him passed out with his pants down and we just left to my grandma's. Another incident was that me and my siblings were home alone with him and he basically slumped and fell on the floor while trying to order something. A couple hours before this him and his friend came to our house while we were there and they either drank or gave him meds. We were like 9 or younger so we didn't know what to do. All of us started crying and screaming but I ended up having to call my mom and we left.

We ended up moving to out grandma's a couple years later. I already have experience of my family members going to jail, because the reason why my mom decided to move into her mom's was because her dad was going to jail as well. My grandpa went to jail for in his words a marijuana conspiracy. So that's that. His sentence was 5 years. That was 5 years ago.

Things didn't really get better. I was older so I knew what to do. Some more incidents happened but they were verbal. He got increasingly angry with me, because my parent's relationship was deep in the shitter. I'm pretty sure whenever they got mad at me, I'd be the scapegoat for them to just yell at me about it. Whenever they yelled at me, it was what they wanted to say at each other. So, my dad was pissed about constantly getting screamed at by my mom. Sometimes he'd just flat out call me a piece of shit or an asshole. If he had to drive me to school he'd start screaming about how he didn't want a divorce and other things. A couple months ago we got in a fight that I can't remember, but he hit me in the back of the head with a gun case and started screaming at me. He told me to go to my room and proceeded to rip out cords from the wall.

And most recently, we were in the car alone. We started talking about stuff but got in another argument about something petty. It progressed more and more but basically I said ""You made your life miserable."" He got pissed after that and sped down the road. He then sped down in the neighborhood road doing a donut while a car honked at him. I got extremely pissed at him for this because yes, he always drives like that. When we got inside he proceeded to mock and yell at me ending with him just screaming at me to ""get out of his life."" Again, a scapegoat.

That's pretty much leading up to now. He has done many things, and he is undoubtedly an asshole. But he's my dad and that's that. I have absolutely no emotion towards this situation. He came to me and told me that he was sorry for being a bad father and told me he's going away for a while. I just said okay. I don't feel anything.

This all frustrates me to a point. My mom absolutely despises him. I suppose all of this was one big vent about very personal things that were just in the back of my mind for a long time. Oddly enough, I'm not... sad. I'm not upset. I just... don't feel anything. Maybe it's because my brain has to register what's going on or maybe it's just a bitterness. But I don't.

As of right now, I just needed to let this out. They always say never to hold shit in, because that'll kick you in the long run. So I did. I'd like to imagine, maybe if he was out of my life sooner or maybe he was different, would I even become fucked up? I don't know. All I know now is that I'm just very fatigued as usual. Exhausted, honestly. I presume that's why my memory is shit right now but yeah. Everything is just very stressful and frustrating. My dad got kicked out of the house finally today and I have no idea where he's going. Or even if he is going to end up getting sentenced. We have no money to pay a fine or do anything like that. ",3/11/2019
1002,vvvrrrttt,1,"I'm currently 15, my mom is living with my grandma (her mom) and my two siblings and my dad is kicked out of the house staying with his mom. My parents are still not divorced but my mom is planning to.

A couple hours ago I was staying at the house alone when my dad came over to visit. Already knowing he was going to be upset and depressive I tried to be with him. Throughout the whole nearly 3 hours of him here, he was an emotional wreck and kept going on and off about topics.

He'd said how he hated living here, he hated my mom's mom, how he loved my mom, then saying how my mom was an asshole about posting my problems on social media, how he was a fuck up and how he shouldn't be emotional to me and how it was fucked up.
He also revealed to me that apparently he did crack cocaine and meth when he was 16. I asked if he was serious and he repeated. Until now, I knew my dad was an alcoholic and a smoker but never knew that.

So, yes. He dropped heavy shit onto me but I had to be the emotional support. I told him he should talk to someone and how he should just focus on work and it'll be fine. I'm not good with trying to suck up and be supportive but I tried.

A couple months before today apparently my dad had gone to a bar, alone while me and my mom and siblings were gone. He got a DUI and was trying to find a lawyer but my mom was fed up with the bullshit. I still don't know what the situation is with that but basically I was convinced he'd go to jail by that time.

I've dealt with my dad for years to the point where I don't even know if I could consider him abusive because I'm just used to it. There were many times I remember. Like a time he was fell on the wall after falling out of a chair when I was home alone with me and my siblings, because he either drank or took drugs hours before, and I had to call my mom and we were terrified. I was like 8 then. Or times he'd call me an asshole and a fatass and scream at me because his failing relationship. He hit me in the back of the head with a gun case one time because I yelled at him for shit. 

He's been constantly asking me ""Is it better now that I'm gone?"" I don't know. He says ""Mom hates me so fucking much."" and that'd be true. But I don't know if things are better. Financially we're fine, but only because my grandma has a large house and is willing to let us live here. We moved here years ago, because my grandpa went to jail and my mom just wanted to be here. 
But my mom basically told me in a random convo ""You're lucky we're here, because if not we'd be in a little hotel right now."" So that's that.

I don't know what much else to say. Just dumping out thoughts at this point. I'm not sad. I'm just empty. I can't feel anything nor react to it, so I just have to take the punches.

A part of me thinks my dad is going to end up killing himself over this but I don't know. He hates himself for being an idiot, for living at his mom's, so he said he's just going to rent a hotel. He seems to have hit rock bottom, and I have no idea how to cope with that.",4/21/2019
1003,vvvrrrttt,4,"I just realized how much this depression has really impacted my life. And how this is going to impact the rest of my life until I'm dead.

Sometimes it's only once, other days it lasts and occurs every hour. It is literally comparable to a person screaming at you every waking moment.

Why can't I just live without feeling this?

1005,vvvrrrttt,0,"The only things keeping me from killing myself would be friends and family and the fear of death itself. My family would become broken and horribly depressed.

They already have enough problems and issues in their own lives and I cannot add onto that. I feel like they hate me but logically I know they don't. I only feel they hate me is because of the negativity in the damn brain, which makes me into a complete and utter irritated asshole.

The other thing is the death itself. I've contemplated countless times. But I don't have a belief. I believe when you die it's all over. There's nothing. I don't know what holds me back from facing that, maybe its just the slim chance of hope.
The reasoning behind why I want to die is because I feel I don't belong in this world. I shouldn't be here. I'm so terribly out of connection with people. I am worthless. I show no purpose in the world I am currently living in and I feel more like a sack meant to look like a person moreso than acting like one. People around me obviously don't see me as an actual person worth talking to. I get talked down to even by people similar to me in real life, due to me being so incredibly quiet and unfocused in my own mind.

They kept laughing and I told them to shut the fuck up, cursing, and threw a water bottle at my cousin making her cry. 

I regret that so fucking much and I hate myself because of that.

I cursed and became violent to those little kids.

I am so fucking mad at myself.

I have become increasingly a very violent, negative person.

I fear I'm becoming like my father who would do this a lot and I'm terrified. I never liked kids and being told to watch them but I have never been like this.

I need to take something to control this but god I'm a piece of shit.

I hugged my cousin and told her I'm sorry for being mad and calling her names and that I didn't mean to get angry.

And I don't know why. It makes me feel like a horrible person for hating literally everyone. Every positive thing or atmosphere I feel like I grit through my teeth acting positive.

And I hate it. A deep part in me wants to just scream, to just spite hate, to just kill something. For no reason whatsoever. Around people who I'm supposed to be there for.

Every tiny moment I speak to someone it ticks me off. All this talking, all this interaction is making me break it.

I want to kill myself every single day. I just can't do it, won't do it because of family.

People who I know love me, but I can never ever feel one ounce of love in my brain ever again. Depression has destroyed me from inside and out and I hate every single drop of life.

I am so mentally behind on everything that I basically perform like a child and everyone in my current living has told me I mentally behave as somone younger.

This is due to crippling social anxiety that I have hid away from people and having much mental fog. But this call today broke the camel's back and have not felt this horrible in months. I honestly just want to kill myself. I was dreading that I was going to have a mental breakdown during shifts and get fired, and that is what happened.

I pretty often feel like i just wanna start crying, i can fee like that at any time, out to dinner, hanging with friends, or like right now, just relaxing in my room listening to music. 95% of the time i can't cry though, idk why. idk if it's because i've just turned myself off to it, but it's just really hard to get myself to cry for a reason that is directed at me. What i mean is, i could cry if i'm watching a really sad show, but i can almost never shed a tear for myself and idk why.  I usually just handle this shit myself, i hate asking for help but right now i feel so sad i just wanna melt into nothingness cause it hurts so much. I don't feel suicidal or anything, i'm in so much pain right now is all, and there's no reason why and i just need to do something about it so here i am. Back to the topic, this shit happens at worse and more frequent times now. My main coping thing is video games, those distract me and keep me content, but recently, and more frequently, they seem like they might be less effective. The first time it happened i was just chilling in No Man's Sky and i started crying cause it hurt so much. It was so weird because for the first time in my life, video games couldn't distract me from the pain anymore. It happened again about a fortnight ago in Civ V, wasn't crying i just stared at the screen catatonic cause it hurt so much i couldn't concentrate on the game. Feels like my MDD is just slowly getting worse. Naturally i haven't told my family and friends about this, there's nothing they can do to help so why bother them with it. It's hard to keep all this shit in and i need to understand this. I'm 23 by the way. So yeah this is shit that happens to me on occasion, fairly often i feel like i want to cry but i felt like even if i did no tears would come out, and just now, listening to music i managed a tear or two at least but still feel horrible. Was just wondering if i'm simply broken if this is something that is common/semi common with others.

It's great that they're supportive but i don't think any of them knows exactly how much pain i'm in all the time. Anyway, i just felt like it'd be better to talk about this somewhere than to continue to wallow in my own misery. I've been sitting here, in my room, just crying silently for the past 20 minutes, no reason, just because i feel so depressed i can't stand it. I've been weighing the pros and cons of dying for the last 10 minutes. now to be clear, i'm not suicidal, i'm not going to kill myself, but i really feel like i just want to die right now, or that i want to disappear. The last few weeks, for no reason in particular, have been extremely difficult. i've gone to sleep wishing for death every night and just feeling like i'm being tortured the entire day. I've never wanted to commit suicide, i've never attempted it, but some days i wish i could just end it. I don't want to die i just don't want to live as i have been. it feels like no matter what happens i'll always be miserable. It's a challenge just to feel happy and when i do, i get sucker-punched with depression not long after. Feels like over time my depression just gets worse and worse. fewer things bring me joy and i feel shittier overall. Again, don't worry, i'm not going to hurt myself or kill myself, i don't even attempt that kind of stuff, i just feel so horrible right now and i figured ""Why not talk about it to anons on the net?"" it's better than just keeping it all in i guess.

Recently i had to suffer through having my heart broken after already being severely depressed on a daily basis. Now i'm at the point where i feel i have no real reason to live anymore. The emotional stress and despair has become so much that i've actually become mostly dead inside. I can barely feel anything anymore and what i do feel now is a mix of sadness and despair. All my other emotions are so dull they barely exist. It's been like this for almost a week and i've honestly never experienced anything like this before. I'm not even suicidal anymore. I was though, i came really close to the edge a few weeks ago. Now i just...don't care anymore. I don't think i have it in me to kill myself to be honest. I barely have any interest in anything anymore. Everything is just a distraction now. I barely enjoy the things i used to love, nothing excites me anymore, nothing makes me happy, I barely even smile. I have to force myself to do everything. E3 is going on right now, and i'm a huge gamer so that usually makes me really happy seeing all the new games coming out, but now, it barely registers. Even seeing the Halo Infinite trailer (a series i've loved my whole life) it barely made me feel anything. That's a game i've been looking forward to for years and yet it does almost nothing for me now. Eventually my friends and family are going to notice how dead i am on the inside, and if this continues and never changes, that just means i have to live my whole life like this. I'm only 23 so maybe it's a bit too early for that but i can't help but think about it. Still, i can't see the point in anything anymore. Right now i have nothing to look forward to ever. The only thing i can look forward to is dying of old age at this point.   


But shit.....what do you even do when you lose your reasons for living? What do you do when you have nothing to look forward to? What do you do when the strongest emotions you can feel are all negative? This isn't something medicine or therapy or anything can fix. Things help me with it but the help is so minor it's negligible. Even playing video games i feel hollow and horrible. They distract me, but not completely. I always feel that pain in the back of my mind, or that numbness to the world. I don't know what i expect, if anything, by posting this here. Maybe i just needed to talk about it....",6/10/2019

Is the no girlfriend thing just a focal point for my depression? Why can't I just be happy alone, why do I have to feel like there's a fucking lance in my chest...",7/22/2019

Most of the time i just want to curl up into a balk and cry my eyes out but i'm so disconnected i can't cry anymore. I mean i'm not going to kill myself but how can anyone seriously expect me to want to keep living when every day is torture? Nothing ever helps nothing ever makes it better and i can feel myself slowly getting worse each day. I wish i could disappear.",10/3/2019

There's nothing left to gain

Feels like I'm going insane  
There's no one else to blame

  
Every day it's all the same

Happiness is my go-to feign

Love going down memory lane

Remind myself my life is lived in vain  


  
In my soul, agony will reign

How do I live, my heart is slain

Right from the start, life was my bane

Won't live to use a cane

I'm at the point where i feel like a fucking mess and a monster at the same time. i mean about 15 minutes ago i punched myself in the face so hard so many times it started bleeding then i cried. I feel like a fucking freak. It feels like all i do is get frustrated and cry now. What the fuck is the point in being alive when you \*know\* you're going to live in constant pain? I'm a writer so i have been working on several novels and if it weren't for the burning desire to finish my work i prolly would've shot myself already. it's so fucking easy for some jackass who's never experienced MDD to go on about trying to change your life and be happy, gee i didn't think of that thanks.

531,Mordcrest,8,"I (24M) was cuddling with my roommate (23F) earlier, spontaneously. she's extremely sweet and knows about my depression and tries to be super supportive so whenever i need a hug (which is a lot) she is always happy to do so. Sometimes i'll randomly hug her and she reciprocates non-verbally with no hint of disturbance. Recently I've really wanted to cuddle with her, but I've been too afraid to broach the subject with her even though i know she likes cuddling in general and she's super nice and wouldn't even care. So anyway, we were sitting in the living room and i kinda just decided randomly to plop down on her, resting my head on her chest and cuddling up to her (I know, weird for the guy to do that right? At least i feel that way but i'm too lonely to care anymore) she didn't breath a word of complaint about it, she just sat there browsing her phone sipping her coffee. After the initial anxiety of worrying i might be bothering her wore off i relaxed into it and literally spent a solid 10 minutes lying there with my eyes closed just listening to her heartbeat. Here's the absolute best part. At one point, without any urging, she starting rubbing my head softly. It was incredible and i was more happy in that moment than i remember being in the last 10 years. In truth, this is basically all I've wanted, this kind of moment. A quiet, intimate moment with someone who won't reject me and will let me be weak with them. The thing is, I've forced myself to be strong on my own for so long and it's extremely hard for me to be weak around anyone, but for those 20 minutes i just entrusted myself to her and relaxed. It was probably the most peaceful I've ever felt in my entire life. I feel like if i got to experience this for an hour every day I could make it through my entire life. Of course, nothing lasts forever. Eventually she's going to go back to Germany (she's an exchange student) and i probably won't ever see her again. She's the only girl that I've felt comfortable being around that like that's also been ok with it. One of the biggest contributors to my depression is my loneliness, caused by the fact that I've never had a gf or even been on a date and i'm burning up inside because i just want to find romance. This was really all the proof i needed to affirm that tbh. I was so tired of hearing that bullshit: ""Can't rely on someone else for happiness"" line i'm always fed and here i am, i relied on someone else for happiness and it fuckin worked. I was genuinely happy in that moment, and for the first time in 9 years i went several consecutive hours without feeling even a hint of depression. I know we could never date, and I've accepted that, but being able to feel her warmth and have intimacy is enough for me. It's a shame i recently gave up on ever getting a gf. I just don't have it in me to put in the effort anymore. I'm tired of getting nothing but pain in return for my hard work. I have until May until she leaves, so i hope she can heal more of my heart before she leaves. I will probably never again find someone that i can cuddle with and get this feeling of happiness from. But at least for the first night in years i'm going to fall asleep and not feel like i want to die. One piece of advice to you lads. If you ever find a girl like this: marry her and make sure she's always happy. Most of us will never be lucky enough to meet someone like this that has feelings for us. As for me...I'll probably get killed by my depression, but at least for now i feel pretty good for a change. I hope all of you have someone in your life that makes you feel like this, you all deserve it.",12/3/2019
532,Mordcrest,4,"11 years from now, when I'm 35 i'm finally going to give myself a nice long rest. I just can't do it yet. I have to finish my work. I cannot let myself die until all my books are finished and published. The passion for my work is the only thing driving me forward anymore. I am not exagerating when i say i live in constant emotional pain. I feel like i'm on the edge of tears at all tines and sonetimes, verily, it overwhelms me and i cry. I shit you not my friends, i have nothing to live for, nothing anchoring me here. I don't mean my life isn't worth living, i mean there's nothing in this reality i love enough to endure this agony for. The one thing i had to live for is gone. All my life i lived with this stupid fucking naive ideal of having some loving romantic relationship and finding some amazing girl so i could be her knight. Now i've finally accepted that's just a dumb fantasy and for the first time in my life....i genuinely want to die. The thing I hear most is ""you can't put all your hope in one person to make you happy"" and you know what....they're fucking right. So since i know i'll never be happy because i'll never find someone like that, i'll just save myself the trouble. I'll focus on finishing my work, then i'll drive a knife through my heart. 11 more years...that's a long time but that's all i'll have to endure. The best part of this is, this isn't a passing feelihg. Nothing can save me, nothing can stop me. They lock you up when you're suicidal so they can wait until the feeling fades. But i've had this feeling, this longing for love since i was 8 and it's only grown more intense, it's not going to fade. I'm determined when i set my mind to something. They can take away my guns, i'll slit my throat. They can take away my knives, i'll hang myself. They can bind my hands, i'll drown myself. They can restrain all my limbs, i'll bash my head into something hard until i bleed out. I literally have no anchor. No matter how much time passes no matter what changes in my life, once my work is finished i'm going to kill myself and no one can stop me. I tell you all this, to avoid the comments that will stupidly try to tell me not to do it. I appreciate the sentiment, truly, but if someone lit you on fire would it help if they tried to blow it out like a birthday candle? I'm already immolating, nothing can put out the flames. So, i want to say to all of you: i hope you can find this kind of passion that i have, something that drives you forward like i do, and from the bottom of my heart i hope you can last longer than i will. None of you deserved this kind of suffering.",12/7/2019

Because i know for a fact the only thing i ever wanted in life doesn't exist. I'm never going to fall in love with a girl like i always dreamed of, i'll never get a wholesome romance, my life has shown i'll be alone always. As a 24M what i hear most is that i'm young and i have plenty of time. But if you were on fire would you be ok with someone telling you to wait before jumping into a pool of water?

The world, the way it is now, it's just too painful for me to live in as who i am. Sure, i have a great life from everyone else's perspective, so i guess i'm just an ungrateful shit anyway. All i do is play vidya all day and i don't even pay rent in my 4,200 sq ft house. So naturally, i don't think i really have a reason i should be unhappy. Yet from my core i am in pain, constant, and never ending. I am haunted by the darkness at the edge of my vision and recently it only gets worse. I scream in my sleep from nightmares frequently, I've literally punched myself in the face in my sleep too. I want to claw my skin off sometimes and others i want to cry myself into a coma. Sometimes i just need to feel pain or impact, like how 20 mins ago i beat myself with a wood sword. Now here i am bitching on Reddit in a post no one is even going to fucking read.   


What i want, is romance, i want to fall in love. without that i don't want to live. I'll be 25 in a few months, still haven't had my first kiss and i'm not gonna mince words, i'm a failure. It's already too late to save whatever's left. I know that the wholesome lovey-dovey romance i want isn't possible in this world. After i realized that a few months ago i began a downward spiral from which i will never escape. I still need to finish some things while I'm still alive, things that transcend my meaningless feelings. I really don't want to leave if i'm being honest. I've built with my own two hands a non-blood related family which i know loves me and will always support me. I don't want to crush them with the weight of my death, but what am i to do? I'm not invincible, a man can only take so much torment. Should i have to endure this for them forever? I'll try as long as i can but one day the last of my willpower will erode away.",2/25/2020

549,Mtaskofa,0,"I have suffered from anxiety for a number of years now. When I was 16, my two best friends both left the school we were all at. At this time I didn't have a phone, (this is 2016, what kind of teenager doesn't have a phone?) and though I desperately wanted one, I was too anxious/embarrassed to ask my parents for one. I only kept in touch with one of my friends, who I would message maybe once or twice a month (once I got a phone).

The next two years of school (sixth form) were pretty bad. My anxiety really grew. I didn't really talk in any of my classes except one, and at the time I don't think I realised how much I loved my politics class. I got on really well with everyone, I was confident and talkative and I never worried about it.

Other than that I had absolutely no social life. I really drifted away from my only real friend that stayed at the same school, I just never talked to him and I don't know why. (He was also suffering from mental health problems at this time, and though by then I realised I was suffering from anxiety and probably depressed as well, I couldn't bring myself to talk to him, which I really regret.

I spent every day not really doing anything because I would be too anxious to do things or go anywhere myself and I didn't have any friends to go places with. In the first half of 2018 I realised how utterly miserable I was every day. 

I went to university in September and moved away from London where I'd lived my whole life. Im 18 now, and was hoping that it would be a sort of fresh start for me. My aim was to make friends and become more normal, and I really believed I would - everyone would always say it's impossible not to make friends when you're in uni halls, it will help you to grow your confidence etc. Well that worked out fucking brilliant didn't it?

Even on my very first day at halls all my flatmates were in the other room drinking and playing games and I just went back to my room. I don't remember what I did instead.

And now look where I am. I've been here for months now, soon it will be half a year. I still don't have any friends, I still don't leave the flat except when I have lectures or when I need to buy food. I haven't gotten any help because apart, too anxious to register at the doctor's surgery or to reach out to anybody who's qualified. When one of my lecturers asked if everything was ok, and I think he could sense something wasn't right, I just told him that everything's fine, don't worry about me.

There's been two stories in the news about university students (not from my uni) who have disappeared. I don't think either was intentional, but I wish that was me.

The worst thing is when I think about the future. I don't know if I am ever going to have a proper friend, and I don't have any confidence anymore that I'm going to succeed in my course or get a job anywhere afterwards should I graduate.
I would really love to put the free time I have to good use. I really want to learn German, I really want to cook, develop other skills and make myself useful, but I just have no motivation, and what's the point trying to learn a skill that takes years when I'd rather not be alive for much longer?

From what I can see it's only going to get worse from here. It's only going to be more difficult to make up for lost time and become normal. It's only going to be more difficult to make friends. So why bother?",2/6/2019

When I think about it, the anxiety has been there my whole life, and the depression only really stated 2/3 years ago, but there were times where I remember just randomly being suicidal long before.

Even though I was diagnosed over a week ago I still haven't told anybody about it, it's just too difficult. I don't have many friends, so I don't think I'll been tell anyone at my university.

When I'm at my worst I don't have the motivation or energy to dedicate 30 mins a day to shorthand. Especially because taking 30 mins out of your day to suck at something doesn't feel good at all, honestly don't think I ever did a single session where I didn't burst into tears. 

When, over the summer, my mental health is slightly better (I have more to do and more people around me), you would think I could do some work. But no. I'm so afraid of dragging my mental health down to its normal depths that I don't do anything like that. I just play games and try not to think about it. 

But now I only have a few weeks left and I realise I'm in a bad situation. Still I don't have it in me to actually practice shorthand. So I spend a lot of time panicking about it. My mindset is still that if I can't do this, then I will have to drop out, and if I drop out, then I will have no future, and so then I must kill myself. (I know it's ridiculous.

I quit a job I loved recently &amp; now work in the same field for more money, but new company is a shit show and I don’t think I’ll last long. My new boss thinks I’m an idiot and I’m getting little to no training. I’ve been single for over 2 years and can’t get a date to save my life (fat, shy, unattractive body/personality and have ADHD so when I try being outgoing it just comes off as me being hyper and I know it turns people off). For the past few months I have had to leave my dog with my ex Monday-Friday because I’m not capable of juggling working full time, trying to better myself by going to the gym daily &amp; cooking every meal I eat on top of giving her the attention she needs and deserves. He works from home and lives in a house with our other chihuahua and he doesn’t mind. I still see her on weekends but I feel like such a piece of shit loser about it and miss her terribly when I work during the week. I come from a large family but my parents are both career people and my youngest brother is still in elementary school. Not close with my parents or siblings. Had one friend I considered my best friend but she hasn’t returned my texts for a few months now (or she’ll text me back 3 days later saying “sorry I was doing x, y or z excuse” and never wants to make plans.) I’m good at making friendly acquaintances but it never turns into friendship or even just someone to meet up for a couple drinks on occasion. Depression has ruined my personality and I think I’m probably someone others consider toxic. I’m losing my insurance for a month &amp; a half in a few days and will run out of ADHD meds that I need to function. I’m not starving or behind on my bills or anything but I can’t afford them without insurance. I had been doing a good job of hitting the gym 4-5 days a week and eating healthy but I’ve noticed within the past month here I’ve binged a few times on the weekend and have been letting missing one or two days at the gym a week slide. I’ve had major depressive disorder for years and I just don’t even feel like a real person. I don’t have any friends. That’s not an exaggeration. I simply have nobody to call when I’m not doing so great or on the other hand when I am feeling good and want to go out and do things with others - I still find myself alone. I’m not good at making friends. My family is honestly only family out of obligation, I have tried reaching out to my sisters in the past and they typically don’t return my texts. And now I don’t even have a job I can feel good about. It’s getting harder and harder everyday to stick to losing weight. I honestly just want to die. I just want to go quickly and quietly. I’m so tired and so painfully lonely for so long now. I’ve been this way since I was a kid and I’m getting closer to 30 everyday. I recently have had to accept that I’ll likely never get to have someone special like a long term boyfriend/husband &amp; I’ll never get to be a mom. I know I wouldn’t be missed by anyone (my parents would be sad for a minute but they have 6 other children younger than myself who all have a lot going for them - they know I’ve had horrible depression for years and never really check on me or call me and sometimes I think they’re just assuming I will kill my self one of these days) I just want to be done living. I have nothing going for me. Nothing to work toward because I’m pretty much working to pay rent and my other bills. Can’t save money to have any kind of trip or anything to look forward to. Not super passionate about my career in property management but the fact that I’ve been suffering, really really suffering, from depression since I was 11 years old hasn’t left me passionate or interested in much of anything.

960,Wendy_Clear,0,"I quit a job a loved recently &amp; now work in the same field for more money, but new company is a shit show and I don’t think I’ll last long. My new boss thinks I’m an idiot and I’m getting little to no training. I’ve been single for over 2 years and can’t get a date to save my life (fat, shy, unattractive body/personality and have ADHD so when I try being outgoing it just comes off as me being hyper and I know it turns people off) I have to leave my dog with my ex Monday-Friday because I’m not capable of juggling working full time, trying to better myself by going to the gym daily &amp; cooking every meal I eat on top of giving her the attention she needs and deserves. He works from home and lives in a house with our other chihuahua and he doesn’t mind. I still see her on weekends but I feel like such a piece of shit loser about it and miss her terribly when I work during the week. I come from a large family but my parents are both career people and my youngest brother is still in elementary school. Not close with my parents or siblings. Had one friend I considered my best friend but she hasn’t returned my texts for a few months now (or she’ll text me back 3 days later saying “sorry I was doing x, y or z excuse” and never wants to make plans.) I’m good at making friendly acquaintances but it never turns into friendship or even just someone to meet up for a couple drinks on occasion. Depression has ruined my personality and I think I’m probably someone others consider toxic. I’m losing my insurance for a month &amp; a half in a few days and will run out of ADHD meds that I need to function. I’m not starving or behind on my bills or anything but I can’t afford them without insurance. I had been doing a good job of hitting the gym 4-5 days a week and eating healthy but I’ve noticed within the past month here I’ve binged a few times on the weekend and have been letting missing one or two days at the gym a week slide. I’ve had major depressive disorder for years and I just don’t even feel like a real person. I don’t have any friends. That’s not an exaggeration. I simply have nobody to call when I’m not doing so great or on the other hand when I am feeling good and want to go out and do things with others - I still find myself alone. I’m not good at making friends. My family is honestly only family out of obligation, I have tried reaching out to my sisters in the past and they typically don’t return my texts. And now I don’t even have a job I can feel good about. It’s getting harder and harder everyday to stick to losing weight. I honestly just want to die. I just want to go quickly and quietly. I’m so tired and so painfully lonely for so long now. I’ve been this way since I was a kid and I’m getting closer to 30 everyday. I recently have had to accept that I’ll likely never get to have someone special like a long term boyfriend/husband &amp; I’ll never get to be a mom. I know I wouldn’t be missed by anyone and I just want to be done living. I’m too much of a coward to act on anything but I just wish I could think myself into non-existence. I don’t want to live another 26 years like this. I’m truly miserable. If you read this, I appreciate you &amp; apologize for the rambling.

961,Wendy_Clear,4,"I’ve had major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ADHD for many many years now. I’ve only ever dated one person and TBH by the time it ended I think I ruined a lot of being in a relationship for him, which I feel terrible about. In my early twenties I had a good friend group but life has separated most of us by a state or two and none of them seem to be interested in keeping in touch. (I do try to reach out but usually my texts/FB posts get read and then I get no reply). I had someone I considered a close best friend who kicked me out of her wedding as her MOH two years ago (this one wasn’t actually my fault, she even said she was just being a bridezilla after the fact). We reconciled about 9 months after that and were closer than ever for about 2 months. Now I can’t get her to respond to my text messages either. I’m not bitter toward these people, although I admit a couple years ago I’d say otherwise. I think I’ve matured enough to the point to realize that I am the issue and that I’m just not someone who is very fun to be around. I don’t really contribute a whole lot to anything. I don’t think I’m a bad friend or a bad person but I’m just not a person that people like to be around or be friends/intimate with. I think having major depressive disorder since before I even hit puberty has really left me with very few genuine interests and just kind of a crappy personality all around. Hasn’t done a whole lot for my self-esteem or confidence, either. 

Since hitting my mid-20s I’ve been really struggling with the fact that I’m probably going to be someone that doesn’t ever get to have a longterm intimate relationship, or start a family or have actual, genuine friends. It’s kind of felt like a death or a prison sentence knowing that this is what my future likely holds. I’m sure the main reason I feel this way is because I spent the majority of my life just assuming that friends/love/family just happens for everyone, when in reality it does not. But I’m kind of sick of dwelling on it. I want to move toward acceptance of who I am (someone who is depressed and probably will be forever) and how other people respond (or don’t respond) to me. What are some things I can do to not feel like me being alone forever is some sort of punishment? Has anyone else ever tried to move to this mindset that being alone is just something that happens to people sometimes it isn’t necessarily something to be sad or angry over? Hopefully this makes sense. I know this sounds silly but how do you feel a sense of purpose in life when you’re not able to have meaningful relationships with anyone?",4/19/2019
962,Wendy_Clear,0,"I have recently been plagued with these spastic freak outs where I harm myself &amp; lose control of myself. I’ve had depression, adhd, &amp; anxiety my whole life but the harming myself while spazzing/crying/screaming was new &amp; I figured now was the time to finally ask for help outright. I’ve been in an partial adult hospitalization program for the past week &amp; half (it’s a day thing &amp; I go home at night) and I feel worse than when I went in. I sit in a group all day and feel like I don’t understand how therapy works or something because I haven’t done anything so far but practice breathing (which, of course) gives me worse anxiety. I received a new diagnosis of severe persistent depressive disorder &amp; panic disorder. I have been prescribed lamictal,  trazodone, &amp; bupropion on top of the Adderall XR and birth control I’d already been taking. But I don’t feel any more equipped to prevent my freak outs and to be able to not be too anxious to function &amp; am getting worried.

963,Wendy_Clear,2,"I have PDD, ADHD, &amp; Panic Disorder. I’ve done a lot in the past several months to improve myself and stay on top of symptoms. I recently felt good enough to try dating, something I almost never did in the past. Started talking to this guy off Tinder, we really clicked and texted for 2-3 weeks before going on a date. I had an awesome time on our date and thought he felt the same. 

Christmas was like 2 days after our first date so we didn’t get to hang out again as quickly as I would have liked but I understood the difficulty planning around holidays. We stayed in contact over text though &amp; we had planned to watch a movie together once the holidays were done. Unfortunately, around the start of the year the responses to my texts started getting to be few &amp; far between. The past week or so I keep thinking he’s ghosted me, but then he’ll send a random response to whatever my last text was 1-2 days later. I’ve kind of accepted at this point that he’s ghosting &amp; I’m powerless over the situation. 

I’ve been ghosted in the past many times &amp; it normally doesn’t bug me. I don’t even necessarily feel angry or upset toward him, I’m just utterly disappointed that it happened AGAIN with a guy I got my hopes up about. It’s been over a week since I came to the conclusion that he’s lost interest, but I can’t seem to get over it. It’s been consuming my thoughts from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed at night. I’ve been so depressed about the loneliness that I’m barely functioning, I even called in sick to work yesterday because I couldn’t get out of bed. 

I just want to get these thoughts out of my head so I can function again. I don’t want to keep feeling so shitty &amp; I don’t know if I can ever try to date again if something “going well” amounts to this. It’s like depression doesn’t even allow me to get excited about anything once I’m feeling better, because the fall out is 10x worse than any letdown I get when I’m in the lows. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this, just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head before going to work this morning.",1/7/2020

Earlier this year I did a series of ketamine infusions that changed my life. I felt close to cured up until a couple of weeks ago I felt symptoms returning. I am desperate to get a booster shot but they’re $500 a pop and Cigna won’t cover it so it’s not an option for now.

I’ve been having a hard time lately for several reasons &amp; have had some shitty feelings about things that I think I’d feel shitty about even if I were neurotypical, but since Friday I just feel totally numb and it is scaring me a bit. This guy I had feelings for moved 5 hours away at the end of last month &amp; doesn’t seem to want to stay in contact. My sister had been promising to come visit me every weekend for the past month but has flaked each time. This last weekend the excuse was heartburn and anxiety. I had really been looking forward to some socialization and to be able to vent a bit about my shitty feelings surrounding this guy I liked &amp; it just crushed me when I read “please don’t be mad at me but...”. It doesn’t help that when I met with my counselor about 2-3 weeks ago she told me that’d be our last time meeting because she was taking patients that fell under a different demographic than myself. (And of course my dumb ass is like “oh no I don’t need a referral I can handle finding someone new”...still haven’t done that google search) I’m just feeling like the most invisible shittiest, ugliest, most unwanted person to ever exist right now &amp; I’m utterly dejected. I’m trying really hard to distract myself to not feel that way but the efforts are futile.

I can feel that my brain desperately wants me to cry and/or be angry or spaz to react to my current state of rejection/loneliness...But I can’t? I feel totally numb. I want to bawl over the fact that I’m so lonely but my body won’t let more than a tear or two out. I can’t get that build up of either anger or sad and let it out the way I want to. I am used to depression having me be low functioning sometimes (I.e. takes 2 hours for me to even get up off the couch to go to bed at night) but now I don’t even get the small comfort of release? 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any feedback on if this sudden numbness is something to be concerned about? I feel kind of silly asking but feeling numb vs. feeling only lows is strange to me and idk how to feel about it. Typically I want to try to avoid having outbursts when I’m feeling bad but the world is on fire right now and my life is a dumpster fire and I can’t put out fires on either front it seems like.",6/14/2020

346,Lauraanthony209,10,"For some context, my depression got to the point where I feel like I can't control it anymore around 6 months ago. I (16F) told my parents pretty early (about 4 months ago) that I really want to get help. They sat there while telling me that they saw me getting way worse but didn't say anything. Since then, THREE doctor's appointments have been cancelled (all of which were scheduled for over a month), the youth centre I reached out to won't call me back, my guidance counselor at school didn't show up for our appointment that took so long to make, and my parents won't listen to how absolutely terrible I feel. 

I thought that when you reach out for help you should actually be able to get it, but I guess that's not the case. I'm so sick of trying so hard to cure myself when NOBODY in my life cares even the slightest and wants to help.

I haven't been able to feel joy in what feels like a really long time and the worse it gets the more I feel like I won't ever get to enjoy life.

351,Lauraanthony209,2,"Sorry if this might feel a little rant-y but I really need to get something off my chest.

With each passing day it feels like complete loneliness is getting to me and making me more and more miserable. I understand WHY I am so alone, and have been alone my whole life. It's so hard to find people to get along with and even harder to find people who would genuinely care about me. I feel like I'm so miserable to be around and I bring down everyone who has even a slight chance of caring about me. The more I'm surrounded by other people's happiness, the more miserable I feel. And the more guilty I feel about it. Why can I not absorb other people's happiness as I could so long ago? As I'm getting older, I SHOULD be able to find people who care about me right?  I should be able to fill the ever growing hole that exists within my heart and mind, right? I feel like I'm missing out on such an important part of being human. Although I am very introverted, I get excited by the idea of socializing with someone who truly cares about me. About striving to see them as much as I can. When people, mainly my family, mention my loneliness I tend to brush it off not wanting them to know my true feelings. I know I am completely alone. I know that I shouldn't be. I just don't want them to know how utterly broken I am. And how, because I am so broken, there's no way I could possibly complete another human being. Either right now or ever in my life. I have zero confidence that I will ever fully recover to the person I used to be. Someone who, despite being so alone, was even worthy of companionship.

I am perfectly aware that, when I wake up, I am nobody's first thought of the day. I know that nobody is excited just by the thought of interacting with me. I know whenever I check my phone nobody is wanting to communicate with me or has stressed over the perfect way to start a conversation with me. I know nobody is willing to go out of their way just to be with me. When I'm crying for hours in bed, I know nobody is wondering what I am doing and how I am doing. When I'm (at least trying to) fall asleep I know that nobody is wishing that I could be there with them. I spend so much time, too much time, wondering what that would be like. To have someone tell me what I mean to them on a consistent basis. To tell someone what they mean to me on a consistent basis. To have someone want to spend time with me. To be the person they wish to share every aspect of their day. To make them feel better after a hard experience. To know that when I'm with them, they'll be OK. To know them so well that it feels natural just to be around them. To be able to tell them anything. To look into their eyes and know that they are admiring me. To feel their skin against my skin. To feel their grip on my body. To feel and concentrate on their heartbeat within their chest letting the outside world fade around us. To never feel alone just by being around them. To know what it feels to feel true happiness. Hell, to know what it feels like to feel happiness.

I always wonder why I am doing this to myself? Why can't I be content with just myself? I have been alone my whole life, what has changed recently? Why do I torture myself with the thoughts that I am unworthy of happiness? That I am just a burden of those I care about and they only seem to be around me because they have no choice? I have heard people say that those thoughts are not true and are just a product of my wandering, paranoid mind, but what proof do they have? I stare at my phone knowing that I will not get a notification from someone wanting to contact me. I know what it feels like to have someone trying to push me out of their lives before I am even in their lives as it has happened to me many times before. The thing is, I don't even blame them. I have to spend 24 hours a day with myself and I absolutely hate it. I make no difference to any person I know. I know this sounds cliché, but nothing would change if I had never existed. I barely am existing now. When will this stop? When ask the world how much worse it can get and how much longer it will take to change the world takes it as a challenge. I have been questioning for so long how people can actually be happy and find someone who cares about them as it feels utterly impossible for me. When will it get better?",3/26/2019

356,Lauraanthony209,2,"I know this is going to sound very rant-y but I hope it doesn't come across as whiney.

One of the major contributing factors to my depression has been my lack of social skills. Most of my peers my own age and everyone around me has been able to find people who care about them and have been able to form both meaningful friendships and relationships. I've struggled with social interactions my whole life. I suck at eye contact, understanding subtle social clues (i.e someone suggesting that I should be more quiet or wanting a conversation to end), including other people in the conversation, having a proper tone, and I was once told by a close friend that I portray myself as very hostile without realising it (crossed arms, harsh tone, fidgety etc). I'm in the process of being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome because of these symptoms ive experienced my entire life. 

Many people tend to be intimidated by me because I don't act 'normal'. I tend to be over the top in conversation and try to explain things that go over everybody else's head because it's how my own mind fitted the pieces together. This and the fact that I haven't lived in the same place for more than two years since I was very young has hindered my ability to form relationships. 

I don't like to blame other people for my own problems. I don't carry anger that other people won't accept me because I get that other people get uncomfortable around me. Hell, I get super uncomfortable with myself most of the time. I do however wish that I could form those types of bonds with other people. When I was really little, I had absolutely zero interest in socializing with my classmates. Some kids would notice I was sitting alone and invite me over to sit with them but I was perfectly content with just being by myself. In my tweens, I would spend HOURS going to the park or library to read and be by myself for hours. I was perfectly okay with it. But now, in my teens, I feel like I'm missing out on something. I don't want to have a super active social lifestyle that includes a bunch of people and always going out but I would like a handful of people who care about me. A person/people who would be okay with 'hanging out' meaning that we would just watch YouTube videos, homework or something else low energy. The more I see that other people have people that fit their own needs, the more I feel kinda jealous. Not the 'i hate them for this' type of jealousy though. More 'they're so lucky to have that role filled in their lives'. 

With my current mental state, I wouldn't want to hang out with me though. I'm constantly crying and napping because I feel so terrible. As much as I would like to change my mental state, I can't change my Asperger like tendencies. Im surrounded by so much happiness and I would love to know what it feels like at least once. To truely feel like someone accepts who I am and talking to me is not a burden. To feel like I've truely made a difference in their lives. To not have to totally chase after them to get the slightest bit of attention. What it would feel like to have a 50/50 relationship with someone in which they seek me out as much as I seek them out!! It feels like such a fantasy. 

I wish I could have at least experienced a reciprocal relationship once. Even if it's for a small amount of time, I wish I could look back and say 'Im happy that this happened' and I would finally know if it is possible to be cared about, dare I say loved. I hate complaining about being so lonely because I always feel like I sound really sour. I can't complain to anyone in my life because they all have at least been  able to connect with someone and they don't understand what it feels like to truely lack 'natural' social skills. I feel like I'm missing out on being human as humans are naturally social creatures. I'd hate to sound like such a 'typical' teenager but i don't think anyone in my life can fully understand how much of an affect this has had on my life. I talk to my mom and she doesn't understand that things she instinctually does when trying to socialize aren't natural to me. I feel so completely lost. I feel like I'll never find someone who breaks through the barrier caused by my social awkwardness and not only accepts who I am, but is happy that I am the way I am.",4/22/2019
357,Lauraanthony209,0,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love my mom and understand that she is trying really hard to help me through this terribly rough time in my life. 

I've been having some absolutely disasterous few days recently. I feel even more paralysed than I usually do and am even less motivated than I usually have been while depressed. On Thursday of last week, I had to come home early from school because I was about to have a mental breakdown and was crying in my bed (as I usually do whenever I am home). I had my fan on, as I usually do to try to block the noise of me crying, but I was wayyyyy more aggressive in my sobbing and movements. I was practically shaking and it felt like I was screaming. This was the first time that I can ever remember crying so agressively. I ended up crying on and off for quite a few hours and my mom tried to come in to comfort me. It went on for so long that my mom wanted to take me to the hospital. Luckily I talked her out of it because a) I didn't feel like I could get up nor did I want to go in public like that and b) what were they going to do for me? Make me sit in a waiting room for an hour sobbing my heart out just to wait out my breakdown? 

The next few days after that night my mom has been really pressing me about the 'cause' of my mental state. She kept on suggesting theories like 'maybe there's a boy who broke your heart' (before I move on, that suggestion is pretty absurd because I have a really hard time forming social bonds and I haven't ever gotten close enough to someone that would cause me to become upset). I kept on telling her that it wasn't something in particular but she started getting frustrated like I was not telling her enough. I told her that this is just how my depression presents itself and I'm used to it. I do agree that I haven't been THAT upset in a long time but im used to crying daily. She just didn't notice because I tend to hide it really well. I can stop crying and look completely normal within five minutes - I truely consider this to be a gift. I can walk into class or into the living room without anyone realizing that I just had a complete breakdown. 

Anyway, my mom started going off about her own past and history of mental illness. She started mentioning that she thinks that I'm like her in the way that I don't like asking for help. The problem with that is I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR HELP FOR M O N T H S. As soon as I noticed what was going on with my health, I asked my mom to go to the doctor. It took MONTHS for that to be set up but right now I'm doing therapy and I'm on my second medication (which btw I'll have to change soon because it's working better than the last one but still not completely working). I do agree that I don't like making my own mental issues other people's responsibilities. When I'm upset I prefer to be alone because I don't like to make people uncomfortable. But, that doesn't mean I haven't been asking for help.

I hate to say it, but my mom is kinda oblivious when she talks about her past. In sum, she was talking about how it affected her that she was abandoned at birth and how her parents never really got along. The whole time she was talking, all I could think about was that she didn't understand her audience. My mom kicked me out when I was around 11 because I didn't get along with her partner and I didn't even TALK to her for a year. She was talking about how I would never understand how it feels to be abandoned without her parents even knowing anything about her. Even though I don't like to compare my own struggles with other peoples, I was just thinking that it's so much worse to be abandoned once your parent actually gets to know you and decide that they don't want you in their life. She was also going off about how her parents would never talk to each other and never showed any affection towards each other. She told me to 'imagine' what it feels like to have parents who don't really care for each other. Well, I don't HAVE to imagine because the last two times my parents were in the same room together a police report was filed and a lawsuit was filed (of which I was blamed for of course even though it was a dispute purely between the two of them). I sometimes wonder if she just completely forgets about the stuff I've been through. I don't like to always bring up my past struggles but, when she's trying so badly to convince me that she understands me, it wouldn't hurt to show that she understands the trauma i've been through. 

In the end, I wish she would stop searching for one thing to blame my condition on. I understand that she feels terrible that I feel like this and she badly wants me to get better, but she isn't doing it right. I get that there isn't a manual which outlines a 12 step method to fixing your depressed teen (with a 100% success rate!) but she needs to prioritize what I need right now and not what will make her feel better. Sometimes I just feel badgered and pushed into a corner with her interrogating and it makes me feel even worse than I actually do. 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk. Sorry for the rant.",4/22/2019
358,Lauraanthony209,0,"I'm so absolutely sick of being the only one in my life fighting and not getting the help I can't give myself. I, a teenager, have to look for my own family doctor seperate from my family because my mom is not reliable enough to ensure that I get treatment. In addition, I make all my councilling appointments myself. Not to mention the energy it takes just to movez I'm the only one whose putting in any effort. Is is selfish to assume that a mother shouldn't be so busy that she can't make a five minute phone call to help her daughter whom she's noticed is suffering greatly? I feel like I need to be more self sufficient but, as I am a child, I need my parent to be somewhat involved in my recovery. Shouldn't she want to do all she can to make me feel better? I'm the only one who puts effort into my situation as my family assumes that 'im able to handle it'. 

The thing is, I CAN'T handle it. I can't get myself to do basic tasks like getting out of bed, sleeping normal hours etc. I've been slowly falling for the past few months, but recently, I'm absolutely crashing. I can't seem to convince myself that I'm fighting for a good cause. Every day is worse than the last and I can't do anything about it. 

I wish I had the courage to open my family's medicine cabinet and take out some pills which could be lethal. I'm too plagued with fear. What happens if it doesn't work? What happens if I get caught? I can't seem to find an end to my suffering and honestly can't see myself having a good future. I'm suffering so much and I don't know what to do.",4/27/2019
359,Lauraanthony209,4,"My mental state is a complete wreck right now. I can't go two hours without a panic attack or breaking down crying. I can't think about anything other than how miserable I am. I feel like a ghost - I'm just passing through life (if you can call this life) without having any meaning or being able to feel connected to the world. My mental state is getting so much worse and I can't even stop it from declining. I'm taking the medication. I'm doing the councilling. What more can I do? 

I constantly ask myself why I am fighting so hard. I have to fight to get up every day. I have to fight to get any type of work done. I have to fight off panic attacks daily. I have to fight off the overwhelming despair that's hanging over my shoulders. But, why am I doing this? I can barely think about a week from now. I'm basically operating on the hope that everything will somehow get better or I can just disappear. 

I feel terrible that the idea of death pops into my mind so often now. The idea of just disappearing thereby making everyone else's lives better and ending my own torture is such a dream. I wish I had the courage to take the liberty of  making it happen. There's a whole medicine cabinet downstairs filled with a variety of medications. I could just take some and be able to close my eyes for the last time. It's the only way I'm able to feel I would truely be at peace. The longer I feel like this, the more this thought is affirmed. Normal people don't have to fight so much to just exist. Normal people don't feel such extestential dread ever minute they're awake. 

I don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm fighting with all my might yet nobody in my life understands that I can't just hold on forever. They don't understand how much pain I'm in. I just want to be able to just stop everything. Id give anything to be able to not be in so much pain.",5/1/2019
360,Lauraanthony209,2,"I haven't felt human in a long time and I had a realization that I'm a ghost. Although I used to have a personality, was able to feel things, and was able to enjoy activities - all of those things have left my body and I'm left with the shell of a human being that I used to be. I've had some much time to be able to look back on my life and analyse what my life was really like. I look back on old pictures of me thinking about how young and naive I was. I had no idea that in a few years I would be so completely miserable. 

I also realize that nothing was ever that great. Yeah, i was in a more positive mindset, but I was always in such a bad position. I just didn't realize how miserable I was at the time. I've always been completely alone, nobody has EVER wanted to get to know me better or spend time with me that they weren't forced too, and nobody (not even my parents) have truly cared about my feelings and how I am doing. I have had to beg my mom my entire life for the simplest tasks and I now know that is because she couldn't find a way to care about me. My feelings have always been tossed away and my family has always assumed that I'm just overreacting and being overemotional (i was even told to quit 'faking' when I was laying in bed in the dark in complete silence because I couldn't do anything). Nobody cares enough about me to check up on me when they KNOW I'm having a hard time. As much as I know I need to be the one advocating for myself, I'm so tired of being the only one fighting. I'm tired of how much I'm fighting just to live everyday just be discounted as me being lazy and emotional. I'm just so so so tired of it. 

I'm also simply existing. I'm just trying to get through the day, but even that just keeps on getting worse and worse. I can't sit up when I'm in bed, I can't walk at a certain pace because my feet feel too heavy to even move them, my lungs hurt from the amount of panic attacks I have on a daily basis, I'm constantly extremely nausious to the point where I almost fell over on my way to the bathroom today and felt like I was going to throw up when I was trying to fall asleep, I can't stay asleep nor have consistent sleeping patterns, I'm always sad and in a terrible mood, I'm constantly apathetic and lacking in emotions during conversations with other people and the thoughts just won't leave me along. 

I'm so completely stuck like this. Although I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, I'm having so much trouble getting to it. If it's just getting worse and worse the more treatment I do, I'm so completely lost. I constantly feel so broken that I can even be put back together by a team of professionals. Everyday seems to feel exponentially worse and I can't seem to pull through despite putting my all into it. It just reaffirms that I'm not strong enough. I just don't have what it takes to get through this and I have no idea what to do.",5/2/2019
361,Lauraanthony209,2,"I'm going to preface this by apologizing. I really hate sharing this part of myself because I tend to feel like I'm just whining and im making everyone uncomfortable by expressing these thoughts. I just really need to get them off my chest, so sorry for the text that's about to come. 

Today has been a very tough day for me. It's officially one month until my 17th birthday. Even though I want to be exciting, I'm just completely dreading it. I know that it's going to be one of the worst days of my entire life. My last birthday was spent crying and studying because I had a bunch of school stuff on top of my mental health issues. The more time that goes on, the more I feel completely isolated from my peers. All around me are people with friends, in relationships, are successful (so far) in life, and are enjoying life. The more I reflect upon myself, I realize that I'm none of that. 

I'm almost 17 years old and I've never had someone seek me out to further a friendship with them and I've never even had someone attracted to me in the slightest. I haven't ever felt close to anyone as most of my classmates wouldn't even touch me with a ten foot pole. I just don't know what is wrong with me. I don't smell bad (I know this because I have good hygiene and i've asked) and people seem to be able to hold some conversations with me. I work well with other people in group projects, despite usually doing most of the work. I often try to start conversations when I feel like it (most of them don't turn out, but oh well) and I tend to make people laugh quite a bit as I make many jokes. 

I feel like my observations must be incorrect. If I really am just normal and am actively trying to form bonds, why don't I get to experience what most of my peers have experienced at least once in their lives. I so badly want to at least get to experience it once. Every time I feel like I'm missing out on human connection, I remind myself of all the bad things about myself. I'm not incredibly aesthetically pleasing, I'm such a complete mental mess, I have no personality, and I can't seem to figure out how to properly communicate with people. I've been ghosted so many times by people I thought were friends that I can't even begin to count and nobody wants to reach out to me and make plans. I just don't have that figure in my life and im missing out on so much. I'm supposed to be experiencing all these new things in life but I'm just completely failing at that. Normal teenagers don't spend hours crying and have multiple panic attacks in one day.

I just wish I could ask the people who have just lost interest in being friends with me in the past what made them suddenly not respond to me. I'm always the one texting first and pushing the conversation forward, so did they just not even like me in the beginning? I just need a straightforward answer so I can stop guessing. If nobody is willing to care about me, I need to at least know why.",5/3/2019
362,Lauraanthony209,11,"The worse I get, the more that the idea of death enters my mind. I've been getting so much worse, I don't even know how I'm not somehow dead yet. Every time I have to move my brain feels like it's going to implode, I'm hit with a giant wave of nausea, my legs are fighting to keep me upright and keep moving, and even if I just move a little bit, it feels like I've just completed a marathon. My thoughts also won't leave me alone. I'm constantly reminded of how much pain I'm in, how it seems to never go away, how utterly useless I am, and how absolutely nobody cares about me. If I don't have to get up to do something, I spend all day in bed either crying, laying despondent in complete silence, or trying to sleep the pain away. The light is always piercing my brain and I often don't even bother turning the lights on. 

I just want to escape from this. I'm continually haunted by the idea that I *could* have a successful future with no pain, a pleasant job, and people who care about me - but I can't completely convince myself that it IS possible. In all of my years on this Earth, nobody has shown care for me. Nobody walks up to me to start conversations, nobody wishes to know me better, and nobody cares about my state of being. Even my own parents are totally unwilling to help me in the simplest ways without me begging them for *weeks*. Most of the time I already feel dead. I make no dent in anyone's life and I'm incapable of living. I wish I could gain the confidence needed to finally end this. I have been fighting for so long just to survive and, now that things are way worse, I just can't keep fighting. I need to take responsibility for my suffering and find a way to end it, as councilling and medication isn't seeming to be working. 

God, why did I even have to exist in the first place? Suffering 24/7 does not feel worth fighting for. I'm sick of having an average of 5 panic attacks every day. I'm sick of waking up in the middle of the night crying hysterically unable to breathe. I'm sick of being unable to function in everyday life because I constantly feel like my entire body is decaying. I'm asking for help. I'm reaching out to the people who are meant to care about me to say 'I can't handle this on my own and I need assistance'  but nobody is listening to me. When I tell somebody that I am struggling, I don't want their answer to be 'you have no idea how hard things have been for *me'.* I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own and I'm completely failing at doing so. I feel selfish for feeling like I require help from other people. Why would they help me? I seem to provide no function in their life and my suffering doesn't seem to affect them. I'm failing so much at doing this whole 'surviving' thing and I can't seem to pick myself up.",5/3/2019
363,Lauraanthony209,1,"So today is my dog's second birthday. My family went out shopping for birthday gifts for him. They came back with an entire bag of gifts which my dog absolutely loved. He got a few stuffed toys and MANY treats. He went crazy when he got them. 

The situation got me thinking about the gifts I have received from my family. For my last birthday (my 16th), I received a small bag of random items from Dollarama, each of the items breaking the first time I used them. I was told the value of the bag was around $10. Last Christmas, I got two items (each of which I picked out by myself) while each member of my family got around 10 items each (FYI, all of the items were approximately the same value so it wasn't like everyone had the same value of items) I was told this was because ""we were running out of money and got \[my\] gifts last"". When I made my family aware that this made me feel like they didn't think about me during the time of the year dedicated to family, but was simply told I was being selfish and taking things for granted. Last night, I came downstairs to ask my family for a subscription to a meditation app which has actually been able to calm me down for a moment and seems to be working to minimize my panic attacks (for reference, lately I have been having around 5 panic attacks DAILY). It is quite on the expensive side, around $10 per month but I had convinced myself that it is similar to paying for medication as it is helping my medical conditions - depression and anxiety. I was immediately told that it was too expensive. Later on in the night, I was told that they think they could fit in the cost of the subscription but it was the initial shock of paying a whole ten dollars extra for me each month that really hurt me. Today, especially after seeing the large number of high-quality items they purchased for my dogs reminded me that they immediately see me as a burden. I'm not worth the ten dollars a month which would allow me not to wake up in the middle of the night from a panic attack, have to leave in the middle of class to calm me down, and actually have some energy for once.

I want to say, I don't care about the actual items. I only care about the thought put into getting gifts. It just hurts me that they put so little effort into trying to make me happy compared to each other. It's not that I don't believe that my family members didn't 'deserve' the items they got, it's just that I wish they cared about me the way they care about each other. I've always been the black sheep of my family, but I always try my best to be involved in my family. I don't like talking to other people and going outside my house - but everyone else in my family does. This lack of effort combined with the fact that I have to *beg* my family to do basic things like make a phone call to get me a doctor's appointment makes me understand how I'm just a burden to them. They don't WANT to make me feel better or don't want to make an effort to make me happy, I'm only in their life because I'm their responsibility. It's hard for me to think that I'm worth something in this world when nobody else thinks I'm worthwhile.

I'm taking the medication, doing the counseling, and doing meditation. I just realized what all of those things have in common - I'm doing them by myself. I make my councilling appointments by myself and I get to them by myself, I remind myself to take my medication, and I take time out of my day to do medication. The one thing I can't do by myself is make an appointment with my family doctor since he is located 45 minutes away by driving and I don't have a way to get there. Although I have an appointment for Monday, it took me A MONTH of asking/reminding my parents every day to call to make the appointment. I've been getting so much worse in the past month and it took all my energy just to make sure I was taking a step forward. I can't believe that my mom saw me crying for hours, unable to breathe, and overall being unable to function regularly and still ignored my cry for help. 

I feel so selfish. I shouldn't be so disappointed by relatively small actions. I feel like I might be making a big deal out of nothing, but I can't help myself. I'm constantly reminded by my entire family that I'm just over exaggerating. What if I'M the reason that I can't get out of bed? What if I'M the reason why my entire life is entirely composed of either panic attacks or lying down in complete silence? I shouldn't be so reliant on other people. I shouldn't let what other people think about me impact me so much. I shouldn't expect other people to do things for me. The thing is, I feel like I'm doing so much. I'm just so lost. I'm so completely broken and helpless.

I'm sorry if this entire rant felt really whiny. I have just been completely destroyed by my own mind.",5/4/2019
364,Lauraanthony209,1,"One of my worse symptoms right now is how hard it is for me to move my body even a little bit. It doesn't matter if I'm trying to turn over in bed or if I'm using the stairs - my head is still screaming at me. I'm constantly plagued with intense waves of nausea and it's so bad. My entire body feels so heavy and it takes forever to get my body to move. It's like my body is punishing me for existing. I hate that I'm like this 24/7. There's no break. What feels even worse is that my family doesn't understand nearly how bad it is. When my mom called me downstairs the other day, I was having a really tough time. I hadn't moved all day and I couldn't get myself to move. I told my mom that I couldn't move and she told me ""you would move if there was a fire. Come on"". I'm sick of being told I'm just exaggerating. I'm sick of suffering so much with no end. I work so hard just to exist and nobody understands how bad it is. My entire family assumes that, because I've handled it until now, I'm fine. The problem is, I don't know how long I can be like this. This isn't living. I feel like I'm just going to be suffering forever if things don't change. I'm doing councilling, taking medication, and doing meditation. What else could I possibly do?

Not the usual 'you're so alone', 'I can't do this anymore', and 'I'm so miserable' thoughts repeated - sometimes even repeated with different wording. It's like my depression has completely taken over my whole mind. My entire brain is now dedicated to torturing me with my own thoughts and I just can't escape. Sometimes, during meditation, there are a few moments where I actually kind of feel 'clear', but those moments are few. Every minute of every day feels the same and I absolutely hate it. I hate spending the day waiting for it to end. I hate being in continuous, everlasting pain. 

I just want my brain back.",5/6/2019
366,Lauraanthony209,0,"Today it finally hit me how much counting I need to do just to get through the day. I used to be more general with my counting. Life was only about getting through the week for a while. As weekends are the worst for me, I would count until the next Monday. I would also be counting until the next Friday because I'm not even comfortable during the week - I can just tolerate life a little more. Throughout the entire day, my mind is  filled with 'only X more hours until this class ends', 'only X more hours until the school day is over and I get to be alone' etc. 

Once I wake up, my immediate thought is when I get to fall asleep again as I know that's the only time my suffering is minimal thoughts are silenced. I keep on thinking 'only X hours until I get to be done with today', but the thing is, what happens when today is done? The only time I feel relieved is when the day is finally over, but I am immediately hit by the idea that I need to do all of this over again tomorrow. The exact same shit as yesterday, only it has the possibility to get even worse. I work so hard just to tolerate life, and I'm unable to live through life. I'm working so hard at something that is just normal to other people. 

I wish I didn't have to do this anymore. I want to get better so bad - and I'm working so hard to do so. I force myself out of bed most days, I do councilling, I take medication, and I go out of my way to learn to mediate. I'm just so tired of working so hard. I'm always just so tired.",5/6/2019
367,Lauraanthony209,1,"All of the people I communicate with only interact with me because they have to. They're either housing me, created me, doing work with me, or I was the one who began the conversation. I'm just a responsibility that, if anyone had a choice, they would just chose to drop. 

It's a hard truth that you can't make anyone care about you. They either care about you or they don't. Love is shown, rather than just a word. I may hear the words 'i love you' on a daily basis from my family, but it means nothing if they don't show it. If you care about me, help me when I ask for it. If you care about me, actively put effort into me. If you care about me, don't put all of your issues on me. 

My depression has been the loneliest thing I've ever experienced. I'm all alone. I look around me, and nobody is willing to tough it out with me. Everyone would rather look the other way and just tell me that 'ill get through it' and 'things will get better'. I'm sick of being asked what someone else can do to help, only for them to just ignore my answer. Don't ask the question if you don't want the answer. I don't even think I am super needy. All I need is for some help reaching the proper channels to get better. Yet somehow, I'm not worth a phone call if I don't nag someone for a month. 

God, I wonder what it's like to feel cared for? To truely feel secure and happy? Ive never felt that in my life. I know I'm missing out on something important.

All of my problems feel so small when I'm talking to other people. Problems like 'my family doesn't care about me' and 'im so alone' always makes me think to myself, so what? Even though I don't want to be effected so much by every little thought, it overpowers my brain. I can't seem to use the logistical side of my brain when I'm such a mess, like I am right now. 

The littlest things also seem to set me off. I feel so guilty that I'm unable to hold myself together for more than a few minutes. I'm just not strong enough to deal with it. Normal people don't have to worry about being unable to get out of bed. They don't have to worry about being so miserable they can't even get a moment of peace. Am I just making things worse for myself? What if everyone feels parts of what I'm feeling but I'm just making a bigger deal out of them/overreacting?

I just want to disappear and make everyone's life easier. I want to not be such a burden on everyone around me. Even if I only talk to someone for a small amount of time, I feel like I'm just draining their energy and pulling them into my own problems. 

I don't make anyone happy, evident by the fact that nobody spends any extra effort to hang out with me. I can't make people smile, even through my humour like I used to. I'm just a parasite feeding off of everyone else's happiness just to get through the day, causing them to be dragged down with me. I'm miserable having to deal with myself, so why would I make someone else suffer through this?

370,Lauraanthony209,1,"I find that, at least lately, most of my thoughts are plagued by the idea that nobody cares about me and nobody ever will. I know I need to fix myself because I can't rely on other people for how I see myself, but it's just so difficult to understand why. Why do I need to feel like I want to connect to someone and feel like I matter to someone? Why can't I just be happy as I am - nobody to reach out to me or fulfill these social urges. 

Why have I never been able to connect with someone? Why am I always the one pushing the friendship, and when I begin to pull away, our friendship just stops? Am I able to be an entertaining person? Am I just so unlikeable that nobody even wants to be near me? 

I feel so guilty that I'm letting other people effect me so much. I've never been one to base my entire view of myself entirely on what other people think of me, but it's so hard not to let what the people closest to me effect me. 

I've started to lose so much hope. Every day that passes is another day that I'm just so alone and suffering so much. I want to know that it's possible to care about me. That it's possible that someone can care about me. Even in my extremely broken state right now. I don't believe it is the fault of everyone around me. It's not their fault that they don't feel like they want to get to know me better, it's their own feelings. I just want to know what it is about me that drives people away and that it's possible for me to have what so many other people have.",5/9/2019
372,Lauraanthony209,3,"Throughout my entire life, I haven't really been the most self-conscious. Lately, all of my slight insecurities have been confirmed and amplified. 

I'm failing at coping with this. I should be able to be strong. I'm not dealing with anything tough in life, in fact, I have it objectively easy. Why can I not use what I have? I live in a first world country, yet sometimes I can't bring myself to eat or get to school and take advantage of my country's good education system. My parents are both interesting people, yet I have nothing going for myself. I can't seem to find people who want to hang out with me or be around me for more than a few seconds.

I used to be decent at coping. I could go to school, fake a smile etc but I can't anymore. I could be ok for a few seconds while I distracted myself for a bit but I can't anymore.

Another year of this bs has passed by. Another year of being so miserable. Another year of being so numb most the time. Another year of painfully suffering though the days just by existing. This day only made me remember that things have only gotten worse. I'm less human than I was a year ago. I have less emotions, less stability etc. 

Overall, I realized I have gone my entire life without being able to feel loved. I can't even seem to feel like I'm loving my own family correctly. I feel like everything I've been through and everything that's going on in my mind have completely torn me down and its taking all my energy just to get through each day. How much longer will I be like this? Everything feels like is going to just get worse from here, and I have no idea how bad it can possibly get. I already don't want to exist, and I don't want to get any worse, but I know it's all downhill from here. I'm so completely useless and weak. I struggle doing basic things like walking down the hall and having showers. I feel like I'm letting everything be so bad but im fighting as much as I possibly can.

378,Lauraanthony209,1,"After 17 years of failing at forming basic human connections, I (17F) am now in a relationship with the man of my dreams (17M). He has all of the qualities I respect and is such an amazing person. I could go on forever about how lucky I feel. Even though we have been 'official' for three weeks, I still find myself wondering how I found someone so wonderful and why the hell he wants to be with me. From the moment we met seven months ago, I knew how much I was into him [as a person, not necessarily romantically - that came later ;)] and wanted him to be in my life. It literally feels like a dream come true that we are in a relationship. Before we were dating, I would wonder if we would ever actually be together. I would always shake it off and convince myself that I was reaching too far. Now, every time he shows any affection, I feel like I'm in some kind of dream land. 

With all of the wonderful feelings that come with this relationship, I find myself constantly questioning why I am worthy of being in a relationship with him. I couldn't even begin to explain the list of reasons he is the kindest and most amazing human being in existence because it would take way too long. I will try to sum up why I don't believe that I'm worthy of being in a relationship with him in as little points as possible: 

- I have struggled in forming basic human connections my whole life because I have Asperger's like tendencies (which I am currently trying to get diagnosed) and I have moved a lot thorough the critical years of my development. This means that it takes me a long time to form basic relationships then I have to move and start the process all over my life. Before my current (and first) boyfriend, I had never even been touched by a person of the opposite sex or even been complimented by anyone not in my family. 

- I am the black sheep of my family. I don't feel like I belong and don't feel incredibly loved. Multiple actions by my family have engrained the idea into my mind that I am not a priority for any of my close family. 

- Being the weird new kid many times, most of my classmates had the idea to turn the idea of someone having a crush on me into a joke. The way this would work is that a classmate would approach me and tell me that another classmate had a crush on me. The person the first classmate claimed had a crush on me would always protest violently until the first classmate would start laughing. Eventually I caught on and it wasn't funny anymore. It was fair to say that other people my age haven't really boosted my self esteem. 

- I don't believe I am worthy of happiness. I haven't done anything to help the world and always seem to hurt those who come close to me. Human interaction is hard for me and it is very hard for me to understand what I am doing wrong and read whether another person is enjoying my company. I don't think that anyone deserves the burden of having me in their life since I don't believe I have any redeemable qualities

- I have a very chaotic family. Every person in my family is practically in a war with another person and there have been a lot of traumatic Trainwrecks of stressful events. I don't want to bring anyone into that chaos and many people tend to be 'turned off' from me when I start to explain the conflicts

- My depression and anxiety are very bad and affect every aspect of my life. I can barely get out of bed for most of the day and can have multiple panic attacks each day. It is so much work to get through and I wouldn't chose this life so I feel it is unfair to subject a mentally well person to this

- I constantly worry that I won't make him happy, and that I am just incapable of being a good girlfriend. My mind also keeps telling me that he will eventually just realise that I can't make him as happy as his ex (they broke up soon before we started our relationship). When I am with him, I do think that he is enjoying himself and I am doing something right. It is when I am alone, near or in a panic attack, when I worry about all the 'what ifs'

I don't think I got all of the reasons but those are the ones I can think of right now. Without going on for too much longer, how do you learn to accept that someone can actually love you? He was the first person to say 'i love you' and, on a surface level, I do believe that he was (and continues) to tell the truth. It just hasn't soaked in yet. I love every second I have with him and I feel a connection I have never felt before. I have talked with him about these concerns and I think it really is something I need to deal with on my own since he is not doing anything wrong. I truely want to do what I can to continue to explore this relationship, but this is a huge hurdle for me to get over before we can further grow as a couple. 

I don't usually like to ask for advice on this sub as I mainly use it as a way to vent, but I think i could really benefit from advice based directly on my situation. Thank you for getting though this post, I know it was an earful. An additional thank you also to anyone who provides any advice.",7/1/2019
379,Lauraanthony209,0,"After getting slowly better for a few months, it all came crashing down really really hard. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two months and this is the first time I'm getting so bad since we've been together.

When I have a panic attack, I want to reach out to him first because he is my safe space and my biggest support. I always try to talk through how I'm feeling with him and he tries to comfort me. He's amazing at comforting me when we're right next to each other, but sadly we have to do long distance for the summer. Even in the short time when he's home and I'm having a hard time or a panic attack, he can't come over. I've been especially bad the last few days even though he has technically been home but he has barely been able to see me because he has practically no freedom. 

My cat is being euthenized tomorrow, my grandfather is in the hospital because his cancer is really catching up with him, and my parents have been arguing even more than usual. I feel bad for saying this, but I really do feel like I want him to be there for me when I'm struggling so much. I keep trying to look forward to seeing him as a way of getting through the struggling but that isn't happening. I won't be able to see him in person until the 17th. 

Even worse, when I was having my worst panic attack that I've ever had, he told me that he didn't want to continue the relationship because he didn't think I was working to get better since I didn't want to go to emerge. My family has an extensive history with mental illness, we know that they don't do anything but send you home telling you that you need to see someone. Since I am already seeing a mental health counselor, there was no need to go. I told him this and he seems to understand that better now but that still hurts. I thought he of all people saw how much I was hurting and trying to get better. I thought he believed in me and that was a huge kick in the gut to hear that he didn't. 

We haven't been able to talk in person since this, but we have practically let it go. It still hurts me almost every moment of the day but I'm sure that it will get better. He also told me he wanted space, so I haven't gotten to even talk to him through text recently. He told me that it was a lot to handle and that he was taking my panicked responses to what he was saying personally, like that I didn't trust him. I told him that I am just so confused and I don't think right when I'm like that. That isn't me. 

I decided to no longer try to talk to him when I'm like that, but it really hurts. He knows how to make me feel much better, and doing so kind of makes me feel like he doesn't care to do so. I get that it's hard to handle someone like that. Believe me, I hate having to live with myself when I am like that, but I just need help. I can't do it alone. I don't want to say that I expect him to help me but that is what I really want. I hate feeling like I have nobody. I don't want to do this alone, but I get that I have to. I hate myself for making him uncomfortable and I feel like I am just a giant burden in his life. It's hard for me not to think this when he asked me to not talk to him until he's ready. 

I want him in my life, but I also want him to support me through my rough patches. I'm not this bad all the time. It really hurts that he wants space at the one time I feel like I want him the most but I understand. How do I not push him away? Sorry that it's so long, I just don't know what to do.",8/9/2019

Recently, I've started to suffocate myself either with my hands or my pillow when I'm sick of not feeling anything. It's the closest to killing myself that I will get. 

I like the small part of my body almost thinking that this is it. I feel a small bit of release when my body is asking for more air but it cannot get it. It distracts me from how miserable and alone I am in the moment. I know that people wouldn't miss me if I was gone. Maybe they'd not like the idea at first, but I know they'd be happier without me. 

I feel weak for not having the courage to do the actual thing. It feels like it will never end. I'm using all the resources that I have and after a while of getting better, I'm completely crashing. I'm crashing and I'm so scared of how bad I might get. I want this to end so bad. 

I already have a counselor and medication, so I don't know what else to do. I must be able to do more and I really do want to get better. I need help, and since I'm not getting it anywhere else, I turn to Reddit. Please help me. It's getting so bad. I don't know that to do.",8/9/2019
381,Lauraanthony209,2,"Just some background, my (17F) partner (17M) have been together for just over two months. I had been struggling with mental illness before we got together and his presence does really help me to cope. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, plus I am in the process of being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and Asperger's syndrome but I don't wish to claim to have those disorders until I am officially diagnosed. My family has an extensive history of mental illness and personality disorders but he is not as used to dealing with mental illness as I am. We were friends before we got together and I never really included him as much into my own struggles at the time because I didn't think we were in a position to share that.

Over the summer, despite getting better very slowly over a long period of time, I rapidly crashed. I have been struggling a lot with what seems like everything in my life and I am really trying to figure out how to get through this. Since we started our relationship, I tend to use him as a bit of a crutch. Even hearing his voice or feeling his touch can help me recover from a panic attack or depressive episode. Lately, it's all been so much. I'm having multiple episodes/events per day and, despite trying my best to deal with it on my own, I always tend to reach out to him for help. Last week, I had a very very bad panic attack and at the end of it, he told me that it was too much to handle - which I completely understand. He makes me so happy and we get along so well so I really don't want to do anything which pushes him away or makes him uncomfortable. Right now, we're doing long distance for the summer because he's away working. So the added stress of being in a long-distance relationship does not help either of us. He's always either busy or spending time with people he only gets to see once a year, and I seem to always be laying in bed preparing for the next episode. There's so much distance between us right now - a distance which is most definitely creating issues. Although, it is not creating issues that both of us are not willing to work through thankfully. 

In two days, we will no longer have to be hours apart - but we still need to figure out how to go from there. I don't want to continue what I have been doing by overwhelming him with my own problems when he is supposed to be working and having a life away from home. He has expressed interest in being a support for me though. When I suggested that I just keep him away from that part of my life, he felt like he was being blocked out by me and felt pretty useless. I think that we need to find a balance between something that can benefit me yet doesn't make him uncomfortable. I don't even know where to start finding that balance. I'm sure that I will calm down soon and start to get better as I start seeing even more professionals and using other coping strategies, but I want to know what I can do *right now.*

So I come to you, Reddit. What do you and your partners do to handle mental illness together?",8/15/2019
382,Lauraanthony209,0,"TL:DR After a very shakey few months, we finally broke up and it's tearing me apart. 

Before we were together, he (18M) was my (17F) best friend. We would talk all the time and hang out like friends do. Our relationship was very fulfilling, at least for me. I had never felt so connected to someone, and I don't mean romantically. I was able to understand his likes, his reasoning, his personality etc in a way that felt natural. That never happened to me before. Not even with my family or any past friends. 

Not only are we not together, but he doesn't even want to talk to me (long story) and I feel so empty. We would find time to tell each other about our days and he really was such an important part of my life. I know I was a handful. I have so many panic attacks and rapid mood swings, but he never made me feel like I was a burden to him. I never thought that I would be able to make anyone happy in the way that I was apparently making him.

I feel so mad at myself. I think back at the times when I would be upset because I wouldn't see him as much as I would have liked or that he fell asleep before we could say goodnight. I would give anything to have that again. I just want to go back in time and relive every moment so that I can fully appreciate what I had. 

I feel so stupid for letting myself fall into it so deep. He was my first everything; from the first person to show genuine interest in being in my life to more physical milestones. Now it's all gone. My light in so much darkness. We're teenagers? What did I expect? Yet somehow I still feel into the trap. 

I thought we were more than just some teenage fling. I thought I actually had some greater value in his life than to just pass the time. Now I'm finding myself grieving a relationship that feels like was all in my head. 

I can't stop crying. I just want all this to go away.",2/22/2020
383,Lauraanthony209,1,"I constantly think about what a world would look like without me in it. About a week ago or two, my phone was close to dying and I was having such a terrible time that I didn't even bother checking it or charging it. After about 48 hours, no notifications except from Snapchat telling me there are no lenses to try out (the only notifications from Snapchat I ever get) and from Twitter telling me that there's a trending post I should see. 

I didn't realise it was actually true until then. That if I suddenly just popped out of this world it wouldn't matter to anyone. There would be nobody wondering if I was okay or feeling like they lost anything. That's just because I don't bring anything to the world. I can try like an idiot to make friends only to be pushed out when there's an alternative or when someone realises that it's not worth it. As hard as I try it doesn't matter. The advice to ""just put yourself out there"" doesn't work when you can't force people to want you. I can pretend to outgoing or an interesting person, but that can only get so far. I've tried for almost eighteen years and it has only gotten to this point - where I spend my days crying and wanting to just be able to escape everything while being fully aware that there isn't one person who would care about it being one way or another.

In particular, all trying hard ever gets me is to a place where I'm being used. Whether it be someone who has a crush on someone who hangs around me so they want to use me to get closer to them or whether they see their house as too difficult so they want someone to stay with and a new family, it just ends up poorly. I'm only as good as what I can offer and, right now, that's nothing. I don't have money or status to offer. I can't even provide anyone with comfort or happiness. 

Overall, i just don't want to continue living like this. Either I'm incredibly lonely and have absolutely nothing in my life, or I am just a pawn to be used and then be thrown out for something better. I'll never escape the cycle and I'll never have any meaning in my life no matter how hard I try.",3/1/2020
384,Lauraanthony209,0,"For years, as long as I've been dealing with my mental health, I've been trying so hard to hold onto the idea that things are going to eventually work out. I have continued to try to hold onto that idea even as I am proved extremely wrong. 

I work 20+ hours a week plus being a full time student. I usually don't have any free time, but when I do have it, I don't have anybody to spend it with or any hobbies (unless doing my own laundry and cooking for myself is considered a hobby since I'm the only one who's on their own for that stuff). I don't have a wonderful future planned out because a) I have no idea what I'm even interested in doing in the future and b) I'm just going to need to go into debt doing so. I'm also the only one of my four person household who is working yet I'm constantly told that I'm not doing enough around the house. 

I spend every single second wishing that I could just start over. Even without knowing what I would do to make things right, I know that I've just completely fucked up everything. There is absolutely nothing going right. My sister is on a lavish vacation (to an expensive resort) with my parents and her approx. 5ish entourage of friends for her sixteenth birthday and my parents get a romantic weekend away. Not only was I not invited, I didn't get squat for my sixteenth birthday because we needed to use the food bank to even survive. I don't even get an opportunity like that. Now, we're headed straight back to living that way, and yet they are able to provide her with everything she wants to make her birthday magical? 

I turn eighteen in three months and I have no successes or anything to live for. I'll probably spend my birthday crying alone like I have been these past few years, but even worse. Not only have my parents proved that they can find money to provide my sister with a magical vacation in a hard time, but they complain about the cost of a day trip to a city two hours away to go to an open house for one of my university options (my second choice).

How is this real? Someone finds me attractive for the first time ever this year and it turns out that I was just a rebound and I have had to beg for months for him to even stay by me. I don't have anything to look forward too and my entire existence is a huge burden on my family.

It's almost like I can feel an imprint where his arms would wrap around me. The way he would look deep into my eyes and tell me how cute he thinks I am.

Changing my name, my location, maybe changing my hair into something i’ve never had like a mohawk and getting a whole bunch of tattoos as well as clothes people would never expect to see ‘me’ wearing, just so that way no one who ever knew “drew” would recognise that person and would see some stranger. I guess this thought has manifested as a result of me being too scared to act on any suicidal thoughts since I know that it’ll only inflict the pain i’ve had onto everyone who has ever given a shit about me. I find it so exciting to imagine just having a chance to go anywhere I want with no one worrying about me because they haven’t had the chance of getting attached to me. I’m sorry, I know this is a horribly selfish way of thinking and that it wont help things I just wanted to get that off my chest more than anything.

542,dreworbuskeridunno,0,"Why is it that whenever anyone compliments me on something or says “you’re really kind” or “you’re good at (insert thing here)” I can’t just take it at face value and appreciate it but instead immediately say to myself “well that’s not true/this person just wants to make you feel better/other people are much better at this than you so don’t think for a second that you matter.” 

Why is it that I find myself second guessing things I say and do and convincing myself that i’m a horrible human being. Even if every one of my friends or family members would sit me down and try their best to show me that i’m just worrying and thinking the worst, I would just come to the conclusion that i’m an asshole and that no one should even so much as look at me.

It’s hard to know if this happens with me just because that’s how my brain operates or if it’s because of depression. I would say that for as long as i’ve been able to think i’ve always hated myself, long before I was ever diagnosed with this, I dunno if it’s a personality thing or if the part of my brain that functions to make you care about yourself and respect yourself has just always been fucked. Honestly it’s no wonder i’ve ended up this much of a mess, should have seen it coming when I was younger.

543,dreworbuskeridunno,0,"Just before making this post I tried to talk to a friend about how completely lost i’m feeling and that I feel as if my life isn’t going anywhere and likely never will. He’s my best friend and he makes me so happy despite the fact that he’s in another part of the world and we’ve never met in person but I would give anything to hang out with him. As soon as I send the message I immediately feel that all too fammiliar wash of guilt and shame come over me, because I know that this is just gonna make him uncomfortable and worried and now his day’s gonna be dampened on thanks to me. And sure enough his replies indicate that he wants so badly to help and be supportive but doesn’t know exactly what to say which I completely understand because honestly what is the right thing to say. This doesn’t just happen when I reach out to him though. it happens with all of my friends or family members, I end up distancing myself because I feel nothing short of a nuisance, a detriment, an annoyance, a downer and a problem that just gets thrown to that person and now all of a sudden they’re handed the task of finding a solution to that problem.

I know that with depression it is extremely important to reach out and say when you are struggling and need help. I just can’t do it properly because I feel so self centred for wanting to reach out and get help. Hell I don’t think I deserve to get help, there’s a lot of people who are in much worse situations and much deeper more complexs types of depression so why should any doctor, nurse, therapist, psychiatrist etc waste their time trying to help me? And besides they’ve spent countless hours and tried so many different methods to try to better my situation by even the smallest margin but it’s clear that I can’t fucking be helped. The only way i’ll 100% walk away from depression and get through it is if I try. But i’m not trying hard enough, not doing enough either. And will I ever find the motivation to even get up and try? I don’t know anymore. I don’t even know why i’m still alive at this point ya know? Like what am I doing here, why am I on this planet and what is my purpose if there even is any?

548,dreworbuskeridunno,4,"Being mentally ill. I hate it. Like a product that was incorrectly assembled. A mistake, a flawed machine that cannot serve its function and watches as all the other machines around it excel at what they were made to do quickly and efficiently, requiring no assistance, no cooperation and no guidance because they all know exactly what their task is. All except for the broken machine.

I understand if this seems like a strange analogy for mental illness, it’s the easiest way for me to summarize it. Whenever I look in a mirror, or try to see myself from the perspective of someone else I see a person with irreparable damage to their cognition, and because of this that person has no place in the world. It’s true that at one point or another they would have been used to perform some sort of task but they are now useless because a part of them is not working properly, disallowing them from being at their full potential. Who wants to use a poorly made, barely functioning tool to do the job as opposed to using a perfectly working one? Nobody would.

 I’m a freak and I know that i’ll never be a normal person, i’ll forever be someone with a problem in their brain that can never really be dealt with.

Not really sure what happened but last night as I had tucked in around 10:30ish everything was fine till suddenly my body said “Hey look it’s midnight! This seems like the perfect time to wake up.” And that was it, couldn’t lay down and get comfy, couldn’t close my eyes without it feeling so forced and straining myself and definitely couldn’t get any more sleep. So that’s my sleep pattern messed up. I’m so pissed off about it.

This is unrelated but sometimes when i’m up this late my mind turns to my friends and how they’re doing. How cozy they must be in their beds and how well rested they’ll be in the morning. Or maybe one or two of them are awake right now themselves. Sometimes I think about writing a letter to each of them (those who are within walking distance) during the day, letters about how much they mean to me and how grateful I am to have them. Then later on at night, whilst they’re sound asleep, walking by each of their houses and putting the letters through their door.

But even if it is does that’s okay, because failure is just a stage in the process of success. It allows us to grow and learn, it’s how we make better choices moving forward in our lives.

Something i’ve come to realize over the course of the past two years is that I can’t just sit by and wait for better things to come, for this depression to up and bugger off. I have to fight it. I have to make a concious effort to take charge and push myself. 

That’s why I want to start off with basic excersise. It doesn’t have to be anything too daunting and I don’t need to get any fancy equipment. I can just begin with sit ups and push ups on my bedroom floor and the occasional run around the block. From there when I feel like i’m ready i’ll start looking into a gym membership and spend as much time as I possibly can in there, sure it’ll tire me out afterwards but my mind will slowly start to feel much more energised and capable.

Then once i’ve got a good thing going there, I can look into driving lessons. If that goes well i’ll consider attending a college or finding a part time job. I’ll take it one step at a time and i’ll do my best to not overwhelm myself, cause if that happens I know i’ll get too scared and start to lock myself away again.

I want to hug them, share food with them, take some stupid pictures of us all and just be in the same room with them feeling their presence.

When I think back to the person I was before I really even knew the ins and outs of depression I see a bright eyed, hopeful young boy who knew he had reason to live.

A boy who was comfortable and confident in the company of his friends and could be attentive, witty, fun and a good friend overall.

I have been diagnosed with the most severe possible form of clinical chronic depression, and am resistant to multiple drugs because my neurochemistry is just so utterly fucked. I'm so lacking in stimulants in my brain and body that as a 'physically in shape' 21 year old man I still get winded walking around the house. 

I have generalized anxiety disorder.

I have pretty bad OCD. 

The man who I looked up to and who paid attention to me and my troubles through junior high and high school has been outed as a repeated acting pedophile, forcing me to come to terms with the fact that his care for me was likely him grooming me for abuse.

I have three dead friends. All recent, some closer than others emotionally. The closest was a suicide after I pushed them away to work on my mental health by myself more quietly.

My parents can't stop having nervous breakdowns, my older brother abandoned the family, and my other siblings are filled to the brim with neuroses. 

I've been in a psych ward for a solid month before, and have undergone electro-convulsive therapy for 4 months. My memory is completely fucked and I've lost memories from my childhood and young(er) adulthood in their entirety.

I have a rare genetic mutation that makes upwards of 50% of any drug just not fucking work right on my body. Not just antidepressants, but shit like morphine and ibuprofen even. This makes my depression even harder to treat as I just have to keep pumping drugs prescribed to me in my body at above-regulation levels until I either feel a fraction better or completely collapse again, because no doctor out there has a better idea of what to do with me and my wonder-body. To top this all off, the mutation hasn't even been found before except once or twice in the Caucasian population, its tied to Asian heritage typically. I'm just that lucky damn 0.001%.

My best friend, who I turned to in dark times and thought to be a valuable and upright man, and even began rooming with this year; It has just come forward that he sexually assaulted my younger sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I tell people my life feels comically filled with trauma, they tell me how I should forget about it and be thankful my basic needs of hunger and thirst have been provided for. I'm not saying I'm not; I'm beyond thankful for my blessings in this world. That being said, I just need SOMEONE unrelated to me to look and tell me whether or not I've won the lottery of bad trauma. Which, if not, whatever. We all have to find ways to cope every day, and I'm sure I'll keep finding ways to heal as I move forward. I just need some acknowledgement along the way.",9/9/2019

I know I’ve made a little bit of progress but not enough to get off my medicine. My impatient self decided to not listen to my psychiatrist and quit taking meds. Two days after, I took a brand new knife and cut my arm. I’ve never taken a knife and self harmed in that way, but it showed me that I’m not mentally well enough to get off my medicine. I take about five pills a day, and I keep comparing myself to other people. I’m tired of therapy and medication. I won’t lie, I really want to give up on everything. But my fiancé has encouraged me to get back on my medicine, and I feel a lot better. I just want to be normal...I hate that I can’t sleep without my meds and if I do fall asleep I have an unescapable nightmares. Maybe I have to accept that this is a part of who I am.

795,xxmilktea,0,"In light of National Suicide Prevention Week:

To anyone who’s struggling with any mental illness; just know that you’re not alone. I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for awhile now, and have been officially diagnosed over a year now. Still till this day I’m still struggling and fighting this disease, and it turns out I may have PTSD as well. 

Thankfully, I have an amazing support system. But even with a strong support system, I’m still struggling with suicidal idealizations but talking to someone during this time really helps me significantly, so I wanted to offer my support to anyone who needs it. Please - at any moment and any time, feel free to message me. I promise that I’ll always reply and I won’t even give you suggestions, just my 100% support. 

To everyone else:

If you notice that someone is having a bad day, or have a friend or family member who seems to be struggling. Please have it in your heart and soul to reach out to them and ask them how they’re doing. Suicide can be preventable and support is extremely important.

Also, don’t forgot to tell your friends and family how much you love them. Those three words could change someone’s life, and you’ll never know what you have until it’s gone. If someone takes their anger out on you, or treats you poorly - try your best to understand that they’re probably going through something that you don’t understand, and continue to treat them with kindness. 

As always, if you’re struggling please contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. And lets beat the shit out of our mental illness.

I’ve cut, tried to kill myself, ended up in the psych ward, and take 5 pills to be “okay”. The funny part is that besides for my immediate family, no one knows how sick I am. I use all my energy to socialize and when I’m all alone, I continue to have negative thoughts and impulses. I tell everyone I’m fine, just so my family members can sleep at night and I’m less of a burden on them. But in reality i’m so exhausted of being someone I’m not.

My parents are very difficult but I couldn't say that they ever didn't wanted the best for me, I have a nice girlfriend and financiel safety. I had no major trauma, besides dealing with a narcissistic was exhausting at times, but it got way better the older I got and the better I understood how he works. 

I got diagnosed with Asperger and in connection with that depression and anxiety disorders. Nothing to severe, not in the case that I couldn't do certain things, but that I just don't want to do anything. Besides my girlfriend I have no social contacts and I don't now if I would want any. Interaction with people just feels so stressful.

Besides that I haven't done anything useful in the last 5 years since I finished school. I'm currrently at dropping out of the third university I went to. The degrees I satrted aren't that uninteresting but also not interesting enough to get me to work on something. I never learned how to work in school, at the beginning I was quite good, once I realised, I could get through without much work I tried see how low I could before I would get issues. Turns out the consequences reveal themself after graduation. Since then I'm rotting away in front of a screen for 16h a day, eating garbage, destroying my back and getting noticable dumber over time. 

I'm waiting for the moment of clarity where I realize how wasted my life is and how miserable I should feel, but I just really can't seem to care and I realize how abnormal that should be. Actually all I want is just get to the end of my life with as little hassle as possible.

I wasted my life, not in the fun way with drugs and partys, but hunched in front of a screen, in a dark room with closed curtains, always looking for a quick dopamin hit, doing everything so I don't have to listen to my own thoughts.

Thats still my life and my apathy made it bearable. But now my apathy slips away more and more and I get a glimpse of how my life would be seen from the point of view of someone sane.

I was fine with that, my reason for this behaviour was my sheer apathy towards everything. I decided I can live like that until one day I will just lay down and rot away because i will become even to lazy to get up. 

But now for the last weeks my brain decided to bombard me with the question ""what could have been?"". This is not fair, I nver cared for all the xperiences I've missed out on, everything that would be deemed normal steps in the developement of a person. There is no reason why I should care now, now that it is to late or significantly more difficult to do anything.

I just sit around and consume media to forget about my situation, which works less and less. I'm in therapy for around 7-8 years total now and I can't seem to make any progress.

From this point on, I can't expect anything to get better. My whole life I was shaped by anxiety, depression and resentment and with all effort I could hope to change a few nuances at best.

The last even remotely productive thing I did, was finishing school 7 years ago. Since then I'm sitting in my room and watch my body and mind rotting away. I tried to socialize, had relationships, moved out at home into another country and went to university, but nothing felt worth the bother. Everything besides fulfilling my most basic needs is nothing but a chore.

Over a decade of therapy, nearly one year in the psych ward and almost every medication available later, and I don't think I have really enjoyed a single day in my life. I have tried, so nobody could claim I hadn't. But there was never a chance for me to succeed, since improvement requires the will to get better and I don't want to get better. I know of course, how abnormal and unhealthy my situation is, but nowhere within me can I find an actual desire to live, grow and experience all those feelings that makes people excited to be alive. For me trying to imagine joy, is as hopeless as a blind borns attempt to imagine a sunrise.

Being indifferent towards everything also means, nothing is important enough for me, that its absence could cause me to experience despair that would be necessary to commit suicide.

I refuse to to put effort into even more therapy, if the best I can hope for is making my life slightly more bearable. There will never be a day when I wake up in the morning and feel excited to be alive.

And even if that might be an achieveable goal those moments won't make up for all the pain. I'm now 26 years old and I can't recall a single experience in my life that would even be remotely worth all the trouble.

277,Planetof12,8,"These people love video games and 'staying inside' more than they love their friends. We see each other about once a month, so why should I care? Who are you? I keep hearing about how suicide hurts others, but why should I care about these people? How is that a reason not to?

&amp;#x200B;

I never understood that reasoning. Can anyone explain?",12/22/2018
278,Planetof12,8,"I tried. Believe me, I tried. I spent so much time leveling up in MMO's and chatting to people there about enchanted items. I spent so much time in front of the TV screen. I spent most of my life like this. Even when I got a group of friends, we spent our time in front of the TV and not meeting any new people.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't work. I know it's fashionable. I know the pressure from society is to stay at home because Netflix and pizza are supposedly the coolest shit ever, but it doesn't work for me and never really did. I don't feel at home when I'm alone. I don't feel well wasting my days in front of League of Legends. I don't want to waste all my money on hamburgers or beer at some local bar where people only talk to their group of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go out. I want to meet people. I want to stay up until the sun comes up. I want to meet 1000 people. I want to have sex with 1000 women. I want to meet so many people that maybe there will come a guy that will make me turn bisexual. I want to write and read people's writings. I want to play tabletop RPG's with flesh-and-blood humans. I want to hear about people's projects, short films they make for the fuck of it and maybe take part. I want to make music. I want to paint. I want to hear people's stories, their worst times and their highest highs.

279,Planetof12,0,"Non-supportive environments have no rights to tell people to stay alive. I used to worry how people will be affected if I die. Nowadays, I'm numb to it. My friends watch TV all the time anyway, so why would it matter? I mean, they can just go ""Huh, my friend died, time to go play video games"". 

&amp;#x200B;

280,Planetof12,0,"First off, I'm officially diagnosed. I also have ASD to boot.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've been ill all the time (generic fever and cold). It's both winter time here, but it's not that hot. My studies have been intense. I also lead an intense social life, usually very crowded places and outings that can last up to 5 in the morning (Raves and heavy metal shows). I go to the gym constantly. I'm also touch starved. I haven't had sex in nearly a year and I didn't have much all my life. Recently my dreams have been filled with such intimate touch. Unlike other autistics, my sensitivity to touch doesn't come with aversion but desire. I'm touch-starved.

Can all this, along with the depression and ASD, lead to such a fatigue that causes me to fall ill all the time?",2/2/2019

282,Planetof12,19,"I'm serious. The more I talk to people and experience the world, the more it seems depression (I'm clinical/chronic) is INCURABLE. Therapy cannot help and doesn't do anything. Depression is being unable to walk. My brain is wrecked and I have to cope with it, but therapy is useless for it since it can't reach the brain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in therapy but I have no idea how it's supposed to work or what to do there. It seems it's made for specific things, whereas depression is too general and cannot be dealt with in therapy.",3/24/2019
283,Planetof12,13,"And that's okay. Sometimes you need brute self-discipline. Sometimes no one's there. Therapy isn't for everyone, and most therapists are scam artists anyway. Friends don't really care. Suicide actually DOESN'T hurt people. People move on from suicide very quickly even if they move on at all. It's okay to internalize the world's indifference, and care a bit about yourself. Don't ask for help. Help yourself. It's okay, really. The people who tell you they care are the LEAST trustworthy people there are.",3/26/2019
284,Planetof12,4,"I keep hearing about these, but how do they work? My friends hardly ever get out of the house and prefer video games over life. My parents refuse to believe I'm a multidimensional being. They have a weird ideology of what a son is supposed to be and they care only about that. If I kill myself, they will mourn the loss of the ideological object but not who I am.

So really, I never knew actual caring. What is it?",4/8/2019
285,Planetof12,3,"Self-love is complete bullshit. It does nothing. It's useless. It's not a synthesizer. It's not a sewing machine. It's not a coding language. It's not a good advice. I spent too long trying to accept myself instead of improving myself.

Some people ARE alone. Some cultures are extremely antisocial. TV rules. People brag about how antisocial they are. Sometimes, you ARE alone. That's life. Not everyone is a depressed girl with a boyfriend that 'depression lies' to her.

288,Planetof12,7,"I'm sick of hearing from people older than me, how social and active they were. I'm sick of looking back to the internet of 2006 and remembering how social and open we are.

Now we're isolating ourselves. Being closeminded is a virtue. People don't commit suicide because of their illness, but because we really don't care anymore.

How toxic can we be?",4/21/2019
289,Planetof12,2,"I'm no longer wordy as I used to be. I go there. We talk a bit about how I feel, maybe the self-harm, maybe how I feel therapy is useless. Then we schedule for next week and it repeats. I'm sick of it.",4/28/2019
290,Planetof12,13,"I read and heard a lot about how depression makes us push people away. I know I do it all the time. First I thought it was a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

But more and more I realize it's okay. Despite what people tell you, this depression is not good for the environment. It does harm people. By pushing people away at the right moment, or not letting them get close, we're doing harm reduction. People can't really help and many are better off without us. Sometimes relationships have an expiration date, and it's better to push them away gently than blow it up. I just pushed away some very close friends of mine, and it's kind of painful but it's the right thing to do.

It's a lonely battle. We are in it alone.",6/8/2019

life has become unbearable for me, there's simply too much going on and im suffering like a dog through life, while everything is falling apart.


here's a list.


- i had a surgery last month which had complications and i still haven't healed, and it seems like it just won't heal

- my grades are the lowest they have ever been due to stress and this whole surgery which left me in a hospital for two weeks

- my family is as unstable as ever

- i have an online friend which is giving be trouble, i dont seem to understand her even though things are getting a bit better between us


- my grandma was hospitalized today, and doesn't have  much time left. She has heart problems and i'm not ready to let her go.

- im perpetually alone in my life.


I am seriously at a breaking point. Last week i had a breakdown in my mother's arms, admitting to her that i was considering suicide and we both cried.

Sad thing too is that even if i end it, i'll still not be shit and my family will fall apart since my birth was the only thing that forced my parents to stay together

I've already planned to start going to the gym again twice a week, and eventually incorporating going to swim twice a week aswell.


I've recently stabilized my hobbies and passion, those being audio, collecting vinyls, clothes, tech etc..
