8,27_emilys,1,"My depression gives me these extremely irrational &amp; invasive thoughts at the smallest inconveniences. Things like misinterpreting my boyfriend's texts, my car making a weird noise, or social situations in general, give me intense feelings of self-hatred, sadness, irritation, jealousy, you name it. I know I shouldn't be thinking this way, but they get so strong &amp; pervasive that they end up dominating my train of thought. Whenever this happens, I tend to outwardly shut down. My boyfriend describes me as cold &amp; distant. &amp; then I end up upsetting him &amp; further driving people away from me &amp; the situation gets even worse because I feel shitty that I'm doing it.

To anyone else who has ever experienced this, what are some good coping mechanisms I can use to stop myself from dwelling on these feelings? I'm going to start seeing a therapist in a couple weeks, but I feel really terrible &amp; depressed right now. I don't want to push everyone away &amp; end up alone.

Any advice really would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes.",3/15/2018

Recently, I've started the unhealthy activity of looking at other women on social media &amp; idolizing their lives. How feminine &amp; beautiful &amp; talented &amp; amazing they are. Meanwhile I'm just...... blah. I feel like no one genuinely likes me &amp; that I ruin everything. Wish I could have a complex &amp; exciting life, but I don't even know where to begin.

20,27_emilys,5,"I've been depressed for years. Sometimes it really hasn't been that bad. But in the past 2 years, it's changed me physically &amp; drastically. I have lost every ounce of motivation. All of my former hobbies &amp; interests are dull to me now. My attention span is VERY short. I space out often &amp; make dumb mistakes. At times, I truly wonder if I have ADHD or something. I honestly feel retarded, in a deragatory way. But i honestly don't know. I typically don't make it long with any doctor. Something will always come up &amp; I'll cancel &amp; get discharged.

Recently, I've experienced a little flicker of hope/motivation. They come &amp; go &amp; never last more than a few hours. But god damn. It feels so good to be driven towards a bigger goal. Especially when 99% of the time you think you're too worthless &amp; stupid to accomplish anything.

This time, my motivation tells me to go back to university. I have flunked out twice so far due to severe depression, which drove me damn close to suicide. I have about two years successfully completed. In order to complete my desired degree (accounting) I would need roughly 2 1/2 more years.

Problem is, I face financial struggles. My vehicle is unreliable, the commute is 30ish minutes, I would need to maintain hours at my jobs. &amp; I don't even know if I would be allowed to come back due to my history.

So, I tell myself, come clean to the university, hell, tell your employer, tell them about your mental history, take as many online classes as possible, find a therapist &amp; FUCKING STICK WITH IT.

But the prospect of 2 1/2 years is so daunting..
 So much could happen in that time. I live with my boyfriend &amp; we've been together a year, &amp; even a year sounds like a massive commitment to me. What if I fall into an episode again? Honestly, when I tried to go back last time, i secretly started to resent my boyfriend a little because he had MUCH more free time than me. I know that's not fair.

But I want that future. I want to be able to provide for us because we have so little now. I want to be able to buy him things &amp; not have to worry about getting pulled over because I can't afford to fix my car for inspection &amp; it has 2 month old stickers.

I don't know why I'm expecting anyone to read this through, but.. could someone offer any sort of advice? Or hope? Help me see the bright light at the end of all of this?

30,27_emilys,8,"I was depressed for years. Part of it was my living situation. I had an extremely strict father who never let me be a ""normal"" kid. Everytime I would ask to hang out with someone, I wasn't allowed because he didn't know their parents &amp; ""they could be rapists or killers."" At the same time, however, he never made an attempt to meet any of them. He was too busy taking care of my two sick brothers. He let their condition consume our entire lives. 

So, as such, after years of this, I developed a strong aversion to making friends or spending time with people. I never really developed strong social skills. I dont know how to be my own person. How to be unique or interesting or worthwhile. And I hate it.

Now, I'm in a longterm relationship that I'm happy with, but I have no friends. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, if that makes sense. Not in the context of my relationship, but ME as a human.

My depression does come back somedays, but I am doing much better. I guess this post isn't as much about the depression itself as it is about the side effects. How do I be able to talk to people &amp; integrate myself back into social groups? How do i make myself my own person &amp; feel good about who I AM again?

I always try and keep myself occupied so that I don't have too much idle time to dwell on it. So I work long hours. And if I have off time by myself, I usually spend it trying to accomplish something practical. Cleaning. Cooking. Some other mundane chore.

53,AcademicTrash__,3,"First time posting here, I’m a senior in high school (17m) and I’ve been depressed ever since middle school for all sorts of reasons. I’m depressed, socially anxious and feel terribly lonely everyday. 

I’m posting because I met this girl (a year younger than me) on a video game this past summer. I don’t know that much about her, we’re not that much of close friends but we’ve played on the game together for pretty much everyday for hours and hours since we started playing together this past August. I’m definitely overly attached to her and at first I liked her a lot, fantasizing about how we could be “together”, but idk, she’s trying to “sort of” distance herself from me and it’s been driving me crazy.

As of now, I want to talk to her and play with her for hours but she gets angry at me and just “abandons” me. She told me that she doesn’t want to come on the game anymore (Sort of, more like as a joke) when she agreed to talk or at least text me everyday. I really let myself out to her recently, saying that I miss her and that she means a lot to me. It’s like I’m telling herself how I’m really feeling and she just ignores it and jokes around with my emotions when I’m being honest and genuine for once. She does this constantly, and when I bring it up telling her to stop, she does the same thing as in ignore my words, joke around my feeling and just leave the game without letting me even speak what’s on my mind. Ive started yelling and crying at her while we’re talking, it’s the first time I’ve told someone I consider a friend, how shitty I feel inside.

I’m not blind to expect everything I “fantasize” about, I just want to talk to her as a friend. I’ve only had a few people who I really cared about over the years, and right now she’s kindve the only one i have as a “real” friend, as someone who I could speak and say what I want to and be true to myself with...truth is I need her a lot rn, I think about her constantly, and she’s the only person that helps me cope with how shitty my life is right now (even if she constantly lets me down). Even though she does a lot of things that disappoints me and kills  mood, theres a lot of good things about her, which is why i miss her a lot rn. She doesn’t hate me yet, she still comes on the game to talk to me when I ask her to.

What can I do to “fix” this relationship with her? I just want to be able to talk to her and become friends with her, because she’s the only thing in my life right now that makes me genuinely smile and feel okay with. Without her, I feel like I would have less to live for. It might seem petty to go crazy over a game over someone I’ve never met, but she’s the only person I have right now. I’ll probably talk to her again tomorrow. Any thoughts?",12/23/2018
54,AcademicTrash__,52," 

I’m a 17 year old guy. I’m writing this now because a girl I’m attached to has slowly been drifting apart from me. We were never too close to begin with, and much of it is one-sided, and I met her online but she was the one person who made me feel like I could be truly be myself with. I realized, she made me feel accepted, even with all her flaws; Wherever I go, I never feel ‘truly’ accepted by anyone. At one point, she was the sole reason why I could genuinely smile and be happy. She’s also the reason why I could get over my addiction problems. I’ve only known her few months and it was bound to eventually fall apart. She’s on vacation I’ve barely talked to her since in a week, and we’ve been constantly fighting all December.

The only other person who means so much to me in my life has been this friend who I went to school with from 4th-8th grade. He was the sole reason I didn’t kill myself and the only reason I can look to my middle school years fondly. I was best friends with him, and he considered me that way too; He’s the closest friend I have ever had and my only friend at that time. In my eyes, he was perfect, not only as a good bro to me but he was smart, handsome, popular, funny and nice—polar opposite of who I was. When I was with him, I was a completely different person; I wasn’t the quiet and awkward kid that everyone thought when I was around others, and this was really obvious. 

I keep recalling this one time that really reminds me of how much he really meant to me. This was in 8th grade when my depression was at its worst. We barely had any classes together and I only had lunch with him once a week that year. I was having a miserable day at school and I remember standing around alone in the basketball court at recess, wishing that I could die because I hated my life so much. My best friend showed up to 30 minutes late to lunch since he had a test to take. I was the first person he came up to and we started talking. It was only a five minute conversation. But instantly, as soon as he came up to me, I forgot about how miserable and shitty I felt that day. He cracked one funny joke, and I suddenly felt completely normal, as if nothing was wrong with me or with my life. Right away, I started talking and smiling and laughing right back at him, and inside, I felt happy as fuck. 

That moment, I knew he was special to me. In those 5 minutes, all the pent up depression, social anxiety, stress and loneliness I had didn’t affect me—Instead I was just happy and content in the moment. To this day, he doesn’t know that I was suffering with all that depression and loneliness—Yet he meant the world to me at that time.

57,AcademicTrash__,1,"I hate it so much how when I try to write my college essays. I'm applying to top colleges (Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, etc.) because I've maintained good grades and they're all asking me, when's the time where you exhibited ""character"", what clubs and extracurriculars have you participated in? , what do you like to do in your free time? Like hey I'm busy struggling with depression, I've been depressed all my life. So no, I don't do anything special and I don't have any accomplishments, I have nothing exciting to write about because nothing good happens in my life nor do I even hang around with my family or friends a lot. I'm too anxious to even go out and talk to people, it's hard for me already going to school for 8 hours a day and trying to get good grades. So I have to bullshit about things I could never relate to when the essays are mostly due in three days, haha, I have to pretend as if I'm a good person who lives a happy life.

To any admission officers, I want to tell you, I have no personal stories that are exciting or admirable for you to hear because my life simply is shit. I hate myself and I hate my life, that's the truth.",12/31/2018
58,AcademicTrash__,0,"Anyone have people they're somewhat close to, but not really? It feels like I've never really been ""true"" friends with anyone except for maybe five years ago.

I feel like in my past, I've tried my best to befriend and talk to people. Of course I can't do that everyday, then I wouldn't struggle with depression and social anxiety but, when it's the first day of school, first day of practice, first day of something new with new people, I've always ""tried"" my best to become friends with people. Like I know I'm not the best socially or I wouldn't have social anxiety, but I tried to do what isn't weird, to not be quiet, to open myself up, to ""act"" friendly to people, to ""try"" to make jokes - I'm not completely out of it; I might not know what is the right thing to say to someone, but I certainly know what I shouldn't act like, and what other people do to make friends and everything. And at first, it works out well, but the friendship never progresses...It's like there's a giant barrier between just talking a bit everyday at work or school, then to actually being friends and spending time together and talking to each other at other times. Sometimes, the first day isn't too bad, I meet a lot of friendly people and I say all the right things, but as time goes on...that's all I get to. I'm like the friend you make on the first week of school, then as the time goes on, they start really meeting their true friends.

And from all those experiences where the people who I tried to be friends with and started off well but never really went well, it's like I really tried to ""be myself"",""let myself out"" and ""express myself"", but they it never worked out.

I think that's part of why I'm so socially anxious and depressed day to day. I'm always let down when I am myself. I forgot a lot of those instances but, it still shaped how I am today. Every time I tried to really be myself, and talk, I'm let down, and I get my heart broken. I think a part of why I'm quiet in class or in a group is because of this too; I talk out my mind (And try to say the right things), but I'm afraid that they will hate and disapprove what I say. And funnily someone else will say something that's just the same thing on my mind, and they get an applause and treated like some genius. But it's not just all in my head either, cause it never goes right every time.

I'm a hs senior now and I've been thinking; I have some guys in my class who sits next to me who I talk to everyday. Not friends but, we just know each other and talk a bit in class everyday. Just friendly talks, but we're not friends. But I remember freshmen year, when I tried to befriend him when I first got to school, and it never really working out at all. I have a lot of people like that. It's like the moment I try to be myself and try to actually become friends, they start to not like me and drifts away. As if I'm just meant to be an acquaintance, or a classmate, or just someone you don't really know that sometimes you small talk with. But not friends, especially real ones.

**TLDR;** I don't have anyone. But I do have classmates and people I know little who I talk to sometimes (not out of pity), and yet when I try to ""open up"" it all falls apart. I'm constantly let down when I speak my mind and try my best, so no shit I'm scared out of my mind when I have to talk a lot or speak up. I'm gonna be fighting loneliness for a long time. I know some people might have it worse, and I am m truly grateful for some people I've met, but I don't want it to be like this for the rest of my life. I just wish it gets better, cause I have no one rn. I'll try",3/15/2019
59,AcademicTrash__,3,"Idk if this is too optimistic to ask here but I figured it’s the best place to ask. I had depression since middle school (I’m in college) and it still lingers around today but I admit I’m in a much better place now. I figure it’s mostly people based—loneliness, social anxiety, etc—I’ve only had a few close people I call friends, and truthfully I’m barely close to them at all. 

But yet, talking to these people I hold in such a grateful in my heart about, these people who in realty know little about me, I feel an overwhelming sense of pride??? of, or admiration, just how much a good person they are. Maybe it’s this one friends humor and their sociability, their confidence or something as small as their fashion sense. I’m glad to befriend or just talk to these people who have meant so much when I felt like I had no one, even if it was someone online or someone I just talked for 10 minutes every week.

And thinking about them...it just makes me want to improve and better myself for them. So I can be a better friend then them. So I don’t let them down. It might sound reliant or superficial, but it’s a positive feeling for me. I just texted this person for 5 minutes while I’ve been wasting my summer vacation, and I feel like this again. The feeling will subside but I am grateful for these few people even if I feel like shit all the time.

TL;DR I struggle with low self esteem and loneliness but sometimes I just feel overly proud and admiration of my friends to the point where I feel the motivation to want to better myself for them, even if the feeling fades.",6/2/2019
63,AcademicTrash__,10,"My personality is not optimistic by any means. I don't have a bright, upbeat and positive personality. I'm not that kind of person, nor do I want to be. 

But regarding depression, regarding how I feel inside, regarding my life and my future, no matter how shitty I feel, I have this small thread of hope deep deep deep in my head, that I hold on to subconsciously. I hold on desperately to this idea that it's going to get better, that all the moments when I daydream is going to be my future. That one day, my life will be changed and I'll be in a place where I've never been before.

Maybe it's because I'm still young (18) and I feel like I have a future. Maybe it's my personality. Maybe it's cause I can be emotional and sensitive. But as hopeless as everything feels and as much pessimistic attitude how hold in daily life, I feel like deep deep deep inside my head, I have this hope and optimism that yearns for a bright side. It's like even if I constantly give up in my daily life, I just can't give up this hope that's embedded deep inside my head.

Can anyone relate? I just want to know if there is people like me. I know depression is something many experience, where many feel hopeless, and I feel that way too sometimes, but there is always this strange hope that I hang onto subconsciously. I look up hope in this subreddit, and it's only about losing hope, but nothing about this hidden feeling I hold on to.",10/20/2019

Family members are dying, old friends are leaving me in the dust, every boy I love abandons me - like a switch went off in their brain they don’t want me anymore. 

Yesterday I found a blog post featuring my father, someone had asked random people their biggest fear, my father responded “losing my children to anything.” And remembering that is the only reason I’m still here typing this to you guys right now.

But God, the pavement was slick and wet, it was raining pretty steadily, I could’ve just taken a sharp turn and my car would’ve spun out and gotten destroyed by one of the semi-trucks around me.

Most of my friends can’t stand me anymore because all I do now is cry, I’m no fun to be around. I got sent home from work early again tonight (second night in a row) for crying and having a breakdown at work.

My boyfriend, who I loved more than anything, and was the brightest light in my life, left me. He walked out on me after promising he wouldn’t.

All I have left is my parents but they’re 150 miles away. 

Everyone says I need to take care of myself but I don’t want to. I just want to waste away until I die. Every night I go to bed and I pray to God that I don’t wake up. God has taken everyone out of my life, he might as well take me too. 

I thought I knew pain, I thought I knew loneliness, but NOTHING compares to what I feel right now, I’m such a burden in this world. Nobody wants me. I can’t go on.

The only people who care are my parents and frankly I don’t want to burden them anymore by being the useless, piece of shit daughter I turned out to be.

I keep driving recklessly in hopes of crashing, and every time I loose control I somehow get lucky and regain control before someone can hit me or before I crash.

73,Alexapro_,1,"Hey guys, so it’s obvious from many of my previous posts that I’m doing very...rough. I’ve taken a lot of blows this month and I’ve been pushed down so many times that now I am struggling to stand back up.

One of the side effects of this is I stopped eating. I either don’t have the energy to cook and don’t wanna blow all my money on takeout, I’m too sick with anxiety to eat, or I’m simply so depressed and have no appetite. I’ve been eating maybe 600 calories max? If I get to 1,000 calories it’s a good day. The issue is I was never overweight to begin with, I’m 5’4 and was about 120 pounds, now I don’t know what I am? All I know is I stopped menstruating, my clothes are falling off my body, and I can see every one of my rips. I’m starting to look unhealthily thin, and I don’t know what to do? I’m trying so hard to force myself to eat but I just can’t do it. And when I can suppress the depression long enough to get some food I nearly vomit just trying to eat soup or oatmeal. Sometimes I get sick after.

Are there any high calorie, easy to eat foods I can try? I’m having bagels with cream cheese because I know that’s pretty high in calories, fat and carbs. I don’t want to gain a lot of weight back because realistically I haven’t lost a lot I was just already thin enough to begin with but if I can put on a few pounds just to look healthy again that would be nice. 

Anyone else deal with these issues when depressed? Seriously, I need help. ",2/28/2019

I’m alone, useless, unloveable, stupid, pathetic, good for nothing. Only reason I’m still here is for my mom, other than that I’m ready to fucking go. Everything’s meaningless. Everyone leaves me eventually.
Lost 3 good friends. Lost sight of the future. Became addicted to self-harm. I have no home here at school because my roommate is toxic and makes me uncomfortable and anxious in my own “home”. I’m an outcast. Very few people like me or care for me. Oh and the best part, the love of my life, the only person I had left who made me feel valuable and important, left me - and that was the final nail in the coffin.

Every night I used to pray to God for peace and joy, and for my love - that he may find happiness and overcome the battles he fights daily. Now I pray that God will take me in my sleep and I don’t have to wake up and face another day of pain, heartbreak, and loneliness tomorrow.

They flashed me a smile, while their arms were around their lovers waist, and they told me I was a great person with so much potential. 


But all I heard was them them telling me I was pathetic in the nicest way possible.
 
While every person I saw, from the checkout at the grocery store, to the old lady in the parking lot, looked at me with pity in their eyes.

And with a smile on their lips they told me it was okay if I wasn't okay, but I simply smiled and assured them that I was doing just fine.


But when I tell you I'm thinking of doing something new with my hair, what I meant was last night I held a pair of scissors to my head, wanting to chop off every strand. I thought that maybe if I didn’t look like myself anymore, I wouldn’t have to be myself anymore.
But I can't tell you that because I am doing just fine.


And when I tell you I'm not hungry because I had a big lunch, the truth is I haven't eaten in hours, but I enjoy the feeling of hunger because I like to think that my body is slowly eating itself until my entire being is swallowed and I no longer exist.

And when I tell you that I went out last night and had a great time, the truth is I drove around by myself singing music at the top of my lungs, hoping that if I sang loud enough I would go deaf and no longer have to hear my own cries or their sorry whispers.

And when I tell you that I went out and talked to someone today, the truth is I was talking to my own reflection, feeding it insults and hate until my voice was hoarse, hoping I'd go mute so I wouldn't have to lie to you...

There was nothing that set me off or triggered me, like today was just fine and average. One of my friends asked me to hangout before our class together and she and I had a good time. Like really today was fine, everything’s fine, but I can’t shake this emptiness I feel right now. I feel super alone and I feel like everyone hates me and I’m going to lose the people I love.

- have had my heartbroken by the love of my life. No boyfriend of mine has ever loved me before, but then he came alone and he was so special and wonderful I really thought he could love me, I really, really did. But he didn’t, and he dropped me. 
- lost one of my best friends. All because I was depressed after the break up and she didn’t want to handle it. I tried reaching out to her multiple times, she ignored it. Now she’s friends with my abusive ex-boyfriend who she KNOWS absurd me. But she’s rather be friends with him than me. 
- had my mother criticize my appearance on multiple occasions. Even make comments about what I eat or drink. Just everything I do she finds fault with.
- had both my parents bring me down. Nothing I’ve done is good enough. And when I try to speak up they call me a bitch to my face. I’m 20 years old and they still find ways to ridicule me and make me feel 12 years old.

I have never hated myself so much. The only good man I’ve ever met couldn’t even find it in himself to love me, even though I will literally go to the ends of the earth for him, and that’s not an exaggeration. I am clearly worse than an abusive man since the one person I thought loved and cared for me, dropped me, befriended him, and made me out to be the bad guy in all of it. My own parents constantly tear me down. I’m just the scum of the Earth.
In early March I had made a plan to kill myself on April 28th. I kinda put that to the side but now I’m thinking about it again because everything that’s transpired has made me realize I truly am worthless scum, I’m a shit person who is absolutely unlovable and offers nothing to this world.

I said things and did things that are out of character for me and in no way reflect who I am or who I want to be. It just recently dawned upon me that I haven’t been acting like myself and I don’t like the way I’ve been acting.
But now that it’s hit me I am left feeling ashamed of myself and hateful of who I am.

123,AnonymousPerson001,18,"I feel so stupid. All the time. Nobody cares what I think and nobody sees me. Sometimes I actually wonder if I'm invisible. I'm also addicted to cutting so that's great I guess. I have severe trust issues and my therapist has suddenly and out of the blue gone bonkers. Let me give you some context. I live in a medium sized house with two brothers, my parents and my cat. I live in an upper-middle class family. We have money, food, a house, two cars and access to therapy. I spoke to my therapist yesterday. I told her that I always feel lonely and depressed. First she said that all teens think they have depression. She then reminded me that 'Depression doesn't exist.' Which later turned into 'Stop lying for attention!' We also discussed how everyone has trust issues because really, no one is trustworthy. YES, she told me that no one is trustworthy! That is surely going to help me open up about my feelings.She also felt the need to tell me that she does not recommend therapy for 12 year old's because they haven't experienced life yet. I CAN'T EXPERIENCE LIFE YET! I spend all my time curled up in a ball on the ground crying! I cut my wrists in the bathroom every week, it's actually become a kind of bedtime ritual. She says ""you don't need to just hide from the world, go do things that make you HAPPY!"" Seriously? I really don't think she has EVER met someone with depression. She knows nothing about depression whatsoever. See that's the thing about depression, all the things that normally make you happy... THEY DO NOTHING. I am sitting, playing Minecraft and watching New Girl with MY CAT, MY BELOVED CAT! And yet I still feel like crap.. I'm on new anti-depressants, THEY'RE DOING NOTHING! I am so sick of nothing working! We then discussed how I just need to think happy thoughts and I will then be happy forever. And finally, the cherry on top, she tells me that I am UNGRATEFUL and IMPOLITE. Sometimes I am selfish, sometimes I am mean, and yet the only two insults in the world that do not apply to me are being impolite and being ungrateful. I am thankful for everything I have ever received in my entire life. Whether it's the phone I got for Christmas or the barbie set my aunt gave me three years after I outgrew barbie. And Impolite? I am by a long shot the most polite kid in my school filled with 700 kids. All my friends parents think that I'm a good influence. I say please and thank you, I offer to help with anything they need. I have gone to my friends house, helped make dinner, set the table and cleaned up her dishes. You might actually think that she was my guest at my house. I am just so sick of trying. All my therapists suck, all my friends suck, all my meds suck, all my teachers suck. All I want to do is sit back, cut and cry. But I can't because I have to keep on living even though I don't want to keep going. I just don't think I can do this anymore. I just don't get the point? I'm so tired of letting my walls down just to get hurt. I don't tell my friends anything real, because I don't trust them. And while my therapist sounds a little nuts, the funny thing is that I really thought things were working for awhile. A few sessions ago we really connected and I actually told her real things, not just what I thought she wanted to hear. I can't keep putting myself through this. I feel like I'm living a lie and I just don't want to do this anymore. Living is overrated. What's the point of living if you aren't enjoying it anyway? I feel so empty and drained.

I just had a teacher tell me that the paper I've been working on relentlessly isn't good enough. And it just brought me back to all the other teachers and people in my life who have looked at things that I worked on for ages and told me that it wasn't good enough. Sometimes I just wish that people could look at me and understand what a miracle it is that I finished it in the first place. I walk 2.3 km to get to school in the morning, and then I walk 2.3 km back home after school. I wish once someone would just be impressed that I got to school in the first place, or that I wrote a paper in the first place! So many kids don't even finish the homework at all... but I do! The mere fact that I get out of bed in the morning is impressive so I'm really tired of people telling me how disappointing my work is because I'm trying so hard and I always try hard. I have worked my whole life trying to do everything perfect to make up for my depression.

141,ArialB,6,"Every time I start school, I am inspired and motivated. I do so well... then something happens. Something fucks up my life and I spiral into an incurable depression.
My family is so disappointed in me. I’ve only attended two semesters straight without dropping out, they think I’m a failure, and I won’t get anywhere in life (they think college = success, no college = McDonald’s). 
Last semester I dropped because I lost my job, I was broke, depressed, and I struggled with my major. 
The semester before that I lost my house to a flood. I was homeless for weeks.
And now this semester, my boyfriend of two years suddenly realized he doesn’t love me. He built up this life for me, abandoned it, and now I don’t know how to function alone. When your leg breaks the doctors give you a crutch for a reason- so you can slowly heal and learn how to walk normally again. I didn’t even get that. So I’m pretty helpless right now. He was my rock and now that he’s gone, I’m a mess.

The one good thing is that I’m getting veneers. Eight of them. I’m going to look so beautiful... but these past two weeks have been absolute hell. My temporaries fall off almost every day, so I’m left having a mental breakdown, calling my dentist who is an hour and a half away to put them back on before work / school / etc. 
That has seriously fucked up my life. I’m getting them put on tomorrow, so the struggle will end soon, but today I had to call out of work because my two front ones fell out and god it sucks so much. And then I missed my classes again because I’m sick and ugh god everything sucks.

If you’ve read all of this, thank you. I’m hoping things get better. I feel like such a failure. Why can’t I ever just DO school? How come everyone breezes through it, but every time I try to finish, something happens and I have to drop out... I feel like the universe just DOES NOT want me to be in school. But what else am I going to do? The only other thing I have going for me is my acting and modeling but that’s a gamble.

I have so much love to give. So much passion and energy and drive. My family won’t accept me if I’m not going to school.
I’m feeling super rejected and I wish I could die. I’m obviously not good enough for anything. ",3/20/2018

144,ArialB,9,"Is fucking BULLSHIT. 

FOR YEARS, I gave him everything. EVERYTHING. He was the first man to actually love me, he built me up, he gave me this beautiful life, he loved me with all of his heart. It was the most innocent, pure, and passionate relationship. 

And now he doesn’t want shit to do with me. He just decided he’s too good for me. “I just don’t love you anymore.”
I feel so fucking unloved. THE ONE MAN who didn’t abuse me or cheat on me or use me.... abandoned me.

I am seriously contemplating suicide. That sounds terrible, over a guy? It goes deeper than that. This man literally took my soul away. He woke up, decided he didn’t love me, and then cut all contact with me. For no. Fucking. Reason. Other than he “just doesn’t love me the same way.” 


I hate him so much. I hate myself. No one will ever love me, and I don’t think I am capable of ever loving anyone else. I hate my life. Why am I so unloved? 
To quote one of my favorite tv shows as a young girl, “I could do so much more, but this is what I get... my reward... and it’s not fair.”

These past few months I’ve been so depressed all of my hair has fallen out. I take Xanax every day to at least get out of bed but it’s not working anymore.
I’m afraid I’m going to drop out of school but my family would hate me. 


I’m gonna search through some of my meds to see if there’s anything powerful enough to knock me out. I’m sorry for the negativity. 
I don’t wanna hear “oh fuck him don’t let one guy blah blah blah”.... like I said, this is just the tip of the iceberg. He RUINED me. Idk if I’ll ever be able to trust someone again, to feel love again, and I just can’t live like that.

So I settled on something better- hot steamy miso soup and a couple of steamed dumplings. Feel god as fuck but with no added guilt from chowing down.

543,Mozartmoonlight,12,"I'm asking for help because my wife is sending very mixed signals. My wife is depressed and has been for years before I met her. At the same time, he hides it extremely well. She goes to work, is funny and makes a lot of jokes, goes out. The only way I know about her state of mind is through online posts she's written under a pseudonym which is irrefutably her, since she's shared her pseudonym and page with me. Her posts indicate suicidal thoughts. I grew alarmed and urged her to talk to me or go to therapy and she seemed very annoyed, brushing it off as she's just ""tired."" I told her to please tell me if she needs to talk about her state of mind and she says nothing.

This is something only depressed people can understand so I have to ask. When you're depressed and suicidal, do you actually prefer your loved ones ignore the apparent (\*Even when you're **literally** writing online about disturbing thoughts I can't even bring myself to type\*\*) or is it appropriate for people to intervene and get you help? I don't want to make things worse. I really don't. But I also feel I would be a horrible person to pretend everything is fine even when I've seen signs it isn't. Some people might say this is just ""normal"" but even on my lowest, rock-bottom days, I've never thought the way she does.  


Is it better that I just ignore it and move on if my wife refuses to address this issue, since everything seems OK on the surface? Or is it better for me to continue to push for her to get help, since she is clearly suffering on some level? Everything I do lately, like reserving tickets for us to go somewhere in a future date, or go somewhere fancy for dinner later in the week, is all done in the hope that she will live for the future.

I hoped she was at least watching porn or playing video games but she's just curled up in her blanket, resting (the way I was asked to).

If I don't cook, there's no food, if I don't wash dishes, they will pile up, and she's such a nice person but she always always does this and I""m really starting to get pissed off.

I feel I came across as too preachy in my tone by saying counselling and therapy are needed, how I take it myself and it's been helpful. Of course our morning was very tense and joyless after that and I feel so awful for not being supportive. I'm just frustrated that this person vents to random people about really dark thoughts and won't acknowledge it to me.

546,Mozartmoonlight,5,"So...my partner and I took in a friend who is younger, and wanted to experience independent living. We appreciate the extra income and wanted to help the friend transition from a stressful living situation at home. The friend said she has depression, but holy cow, I feel a bit betrayed by all the things she didn't tell me about her lack of independence. 

This woman never gets out of bed lately, which de facto puts ownership on us to be her caregiver. She's not physically sick. It's just depression. I feel like she really should have warned us about this because apparently it's completely normal for her to be acting like this at her family's house.

&amp;#x200B;

 She never asked us to be her caregiver, either, but obviously when someone in your home is not eating or drinking water, we would be assholes not to take care of her. Even when there's work deadlines for her, she sleeps in until 3, 4pm - I feel like *I* worry about her job more than she does. Worst of all, she never gets up when I ask her, but when my spouse asks her, she gets up, which I find incredibly annoying. It's like she stays in bed every single day just to invite my partner to knock on her door while she's in bed, which I find totally inappropriate. I can't tell if this is a long-winded method of flirting or if depressed people are too caught up in their problems to flirt. 

  
I struggle with this because she's incredibly sensitive and at heart a good person. So I obviously can't express my frustration with her lest she cry, and I  can't push her to get up and start working, and I also struggle to go to work with peace of mind knowing that she's moping in bed waiting for my partner to come wake her up.

He's exceptionally smart, way more popular than I am, has all the skills and abilities needed for a good life except for this mental health issue. I have my work ethic. I make way less money than he does but I'm the ""rock"" keeping everything running because I'm very duty-bound and never pay bills late. I'm not an aggressive entrepreneur type but I always have a certain amount of money in the bank. 

I feel like a shitty failure of a wife. I can't motivate my husband to do anything lately and I feel like I'm enabling him. I'm sure his parents silently hate me for not pushing him to find work. It's not my job, but it's also true that this current lifestyle he has of leisure and games until the wee hours of the morning is 100% possible because of me. But I'm so terrified of triggering his depression -- maybe he's already depressed? -- that I can't say shit to suggest he find a job. The only times I've asked him to please do something, he asks me ""What am I supposed to do?"" and he often suggests I'm supposed to find him work at my company. I'm really at my wit's end. I'm terrified to hurt his feelings but terrified of this situation continuing 2, 3, 5 years into the future. 

I'm not sure why but I feel like it's my life mission to make his life happy so I would never divorce him. But day by day my respect for him diminishes as I watch him squander his time.

It's currently 2 AM and my fiance is asleep, or at least mostly asleep. Whenever he's struggling, he bottles it up and refuses to tell me what's going on. My family has completely fallen apart, and the last time I spoke to my father was months ago. I told him to never speak to me again after dealing with abuse for over 20 years. It used to be so bad that my ex tried to get me to call an abuse hotline or the police. I haven't gone to any of my classes in weeks, because I just can't find the motivation to get out of bed. I somehow stay up all night and sleep all day. No matter what, I can't sleep at night. Since I haven't been going to my classes I know I'm going to fail them. So, I have no family, my fiance is probably going to leave me and college is impossible. Since my fiance has depression too, I just end up being quiet about mine and take it out on myself instead of bothering him.

She willingly quit weed to make herself better. To help her eat and get her on proper medication. 

However, everytime I think about how she could be gone any time I feel like I'm dying. It hurts seeing her in pain and I'm trying my best to be helpful and do anything it takes to help out. My depression makes the whole situation hurt more than I can handle. 

We talked about passing away tonight and it nearly killed me. She wouldn't even think of it being possible that I could pass before her. She had it set in her mind that she's going first. She's not dying quickly, it's slow and painful. We're both sick, just with different diseases and mine isn't killing me as quickly or as painfully. I have a stomach disease and I'm not quiet sure what hers is, but she's rapidly losing weight and vomiting blood almost daily, and much more is wrong. We've both been sick most of our lives, but losing her to it is destroying me.

She's starting to give up and I don't know what to do anymore, we planned everything, our entire lives together. Now she's telling me to find someone new when she goes. I can't just let her give, she's the love of my life and I'm falling apart over this. I don't want to carry on seeing her suffer, but I know she needs me.

I know pretty much no one will see this or even read this. Anyways, lately my mental health has been really bad, I've been making up excuses to not go out, or go to work, or attend social events or even talk to people. I thought I was fine on Saturday, I went to visit a coworker and I felt alright for the first time in months. However, after I left I did my makeup and went to a ball at my cousin's church. Once I got there my self esteem dropped, I was hoping to feel even a little bit pretty. Once I walked in everyone was saying how beautiful and amazing the others looked, then they'd look at me and say something small like, ""your dress is pretty"" then give me a half fake smile.

I drove there with him and we picked them up, I was too sick to eat, so I barely even touched the fries I ordered. We left, dropped them off and started heading home, then his sister called and said the other sister forgot her bag in my car. We drove back, dropped it off, turned around again and went home. I was so tired and started overthinking that I called work and told them I wasn't coming in. I feel bad about it, but honestly I can't handle it right now. My shift started 45 minutes ago, and I'm praying I don't lose this job. I can barely do anything anymore and everyone is pushing me and telling me that I have to do this and that.

I haven't had a break to just breathe in so long and I'm just done with this. I've had 4 jobs over the past year and I feel like I'm doing this alone.

588,OliSoul,3,"I know I've posted here a few times, hardly anyone actually notices my post. If anyone reads this I just wanted to say, I didn't commit suicide like I had planned to this week. 

At the beginning of the week, my wife told me she was going to her hometown for a bit. Her father didn't book a flight back and pretty much set it up so she would be trapped there, her mother eventually got a ticket for her to come back. When she told me originally my mind instantly went into that depressive side and started to thinking of ways to kill myself. 

I don't know what's wrong with me, I hate that that is how my brain works. I don't want to hurt my wife by committing suicide. She means everything to me and I don't want her to suffer, so I couldn't go through with it. While I was in the shower today I thought about it and what would happen to her. 

There's still a week before she comes back, but I can't leave her, I never want her to have to suffer, especially if she's suffering from something I did",11/17/2019
589,OliSoul,5,"Hello whoever is reading this.

So I'm just going to start this with the scary reality I'm facing right now. I'm sick. Really very sick, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm sick with. I'm losing weight at a terrifying rate and I can't gain any of it back. It hurts to eat and I feel sick every time I eat. I've been having horrible migraines and I'm always overheating. I either sleep for days on end or I don't sleep at all. My stomach and intestines feel like they're being cut from the inside. That's only some of it, but I'd rather not have to explain the other more disgusting symptoms. 

Here's the thing, my wife doesn't want to listen to me about it. She is either scared that it's worse than I think or that she doesn't believe me. But any time I say I'm scared because it really hurts, she just holds me and doesn't want me to say anything else about it. 

Since all this started and I've been getting worse, I've started self harming again. She doesn't want me to hurt myself, but it distracts me enough that I don't vomit after eating. 

I feel scared and alone, I don't know what to do. I love her and I have a few tests set up to examine my insides, but I know I can't keep self harming before this is all figured out. I'm so tired and my mood is crap after all the sickness. What should I do?",11/27/2019
590,OliSoul,1,"Hi people, my name is Andy (22 F) and I'm gender fluid. My wife Daina (20 M) is also gender fluid. And I've been suicidal since I was six, so these feelings aren't new.

Yesterday I decided to avoid certain social media sites, simply for the fact that they make me hate myself more. So many sites and post (even if they're fake) show an unrealistic version of life. It shows people happy, enjoying their lives, going new places, experiencing new things, succeeding in life. I feel like it's all bullshit. It made me realize that I'm nothing, just an unsuccessful nobody. Throughout this shit life, I've gone nowhere. I can't succeed, I'm not happy now and everyone I know or see just shows off how great their lives are. I'm tired of it. I'm sick of being some loser failure. 

So I think it might be time.

I'm not sure at this very second on if I'm just going to hide myself away for a while, or if I'm going to go through with suicide. I have plenty of pills, I have blades, I have anything I would need to do it. I just don't know.

My wife is sound asleep right now beside me. I'm listening to her softly breathing. I don't know if I could go through with it, simply because of her. Sure social media isn't the only thing destroying me right now, but that was kind of the final straw. 

But I think it's time to say goodbye, if not forever, maybe just a while.",12/1/2019
591,OliSoul,4,"So, I texted my father this morning to ask a simple question. He could have easily said yes or no. Instead of just saying no, he went on a full rant right before I went for a nap. I simply said fine when he started saying I was being unfair to him (he has a victim complex) and I should return my car to him, ""since you should only use it for work"". 

He constantly forgets simple things like me needing to get groceries for my wife and I. 
He acts like I'm always the one in the wrong, he's been doing that since I was born. 

I remember my mother telling me that when I was born, my father said, ""we have to try again. It's not a boy"". So that kind of explains a little of what he's like. 

I went to sleep and had horrible nightmares about previous ""incidents"" I've had with ex's and of course, my father too. 

The moment I woke up I saw I had a dozen texts from my father, I started to have a panic attack. He texted me for the next 2 hours, all of which I was nearly vomiting from my panic attack. 

So, even thought 2020 only started yesterday, I already think this year is going to be shit. I just want to end this. I can't stand another moment being my father's puppet. I no longer want to be his ""little girl"". I just hope this torture ends soon.",1/3/2020

She said she's done being used and it's been a year of this. I told her I'd talk to her later, and my fiance heard the entire conversation. First of all it hasn't been a year, second we've never asked for anything from her, third she didn't even give us a warning about this. She told me I could stay there and continue to pay her rent or live with my extremely abusive father. I'm not moving back there, she's insane and I will not go near my father.

So to start this off, I'm 22, gender fluid and my wife is 20 and gender fluid as well. Things have been rough lately. Not only with the virus, but everything. 

Recently all I've been doing is going to work then coming home and sleeping, just to repeat it again the next day. My wife works with me, so she gets why I have no energy to live. I want to be with her, spend time with her and hold her, but I honestly don't want to be alive at the same time.

Since then, we got sent home for a minimum of 14 days to quarantine, we can't go back till next Tuesday, no apartments will be available anymore until the outbreak has calmed down plus we won't have enough for the apartment since we're not working. It would have been alright, we could have made it work, but since we can't go anywhere until things get better, we're stuck at her parent's house. I know her family loves both of us, but they tend to get angry at us for things everyone is doing. I just feel it's my fault, that if she hadn't met me her life would have been different, maybe better. I hate this town, they won't even give the proper amount of my medication. They will only give me 2 weeks worth. This whole situation is making me not only depressed, but suicidal as well. I just wish I could dissapear, but I could never do that to my wife. I just want her to have a good life and with the way things are going right now, I know I can't. Also, I tried to call the clinic this morning to get an inhaler and was told to call back tomorrow.

Two weeks before that I was getting tested for Covid and my boss threatened to fire and replace me, because I couldn't work until my results were in.  Well, friday my old bandmate said that he had a falling out with our leader and told me what he had been saying about me. I freaked out and called him out on his bs.

The research has been published in the journal [*Mental Health and Physical Activity*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755296618301388)*.* 

For their study, the researchers recruited 22 participants who had reported having experienced at least one lifetime traumatic event and who had been screened positive for PTSD.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a 3-week resistance training group or a 3-week control group. The resistance training group completed three, 30-minute high–intensity exercise sessions per week, while the control group completed three, 30-minute sessions of learning about various topics unrelated to exercise or PTSD per week.

In a surprise to the researchers, the reductions in PTSD symptoms were roughly equal between both groups. They believe a longer intervention may be necessary for bigger differences to manifest. But Whitworth and his colleagues did find that those in the resistance training group had greater reductions in anxiety symptoms and improvements in sleep quality compared to the control group.",5/27/2019

My mother was very sympathetic &amp; didn't ask too much as she knew I was hurting but before she left she told me she won't tell my 90 year old grandmother about it as I am her only grandchild that actually got married &amp; she is so immensely proud that she tells everyone &amp; shows people my wedding pictures. 

I could feel my heart breaking 

Now I'm alone again in the empty home that my wife &amp; I bought together, pictures of us still on the walls, reminders of her everywhere &amp; Ive never felt so alone. I never appreciated fully what we had, I miss companionship, someone to talk to, someone to just do nothing with. Too often in relationships people focus on sex (myself included) but I realise now thats not what really matters. I want a team mate, a best friend, a partner, someone I can take care of &amp; spoil but depression has me convinced I'm not like other people &amp; I don't think I can ever achieve what I had. 

This is the only space I have to share my thoughts, Today was the hardest day I've had in ages, I find it difficult to confide in people &amp; at my age people expect you to have your shit together, as a man they expect you to not talk about it but Im 40, alone, sad  &amp; hopeless. I can't even cry alone without hiding my face behind my hands &amp; gritting my teeth to stop myself.",6/9/2019

722,Plastic_book,0,"1st off, I had no idea mushrooms were that strong! 

I recently took mushrooms at an event and my mental state was definitely a factor in my trip. 

At the gig I experienced what you might expect, really feeling the music energy etc. But things really got going once I left the venue.

I left much slower than everyone and by the time I got outside there was nobody there, I mean NOBODY. I was completely alone (outside a very well known venue in a major city) and it wasn’t even late - about 11pm. Initially I thought it strange but kept walking taking in the experience and everything felt great. 

More and more i realised I just wasn’t seeing any other people and stared to focus on that, I began to feel like I might be the only man on the planet. Still feeling good I was walking super slow, stopping at times to look around for signs of life that never showed up. This was actually super cool and I definitely enjoyed it. 

To get to the train station I had to walk through a long pedestrian tunnel which again, is normally busy but I’m the only man alive now so it’s just me. I walked slow, stopping at times to see if anyone else would appear or if I could even hear anyone close but I couldn’t. 

The exit of the tunnel is just where the tunnel ends, no doors. As I’m approaching the exit it disappears completely, it’s just a wall now. 
Now I’m alone, the only man on the planet and I’m trapped in tunnel I can’t escape from. 

This is where I realised my subconscious was playing a big part in this. One of my biggest fears and cause of my depression is the possibility of being alone for the rest of my life, my other fear is that I'm financially trapped in my current situation and will have to work forever just to stay afloat. 

I never freaked out or felt scared at any point and when I realised what was going on the exit to the tunnel appeared &amp; I went through it. On the other side there was plenty of people &amp; noise and I was able to get myself home enjoying the visuals on the way.

Sounds cheesy but This is my ""light at the end of the tunnel"" epiphany, I'm not sure its helped me any yet but hopefully its a good sign.",7/15/2019

My life is my own doing and I'm painfully aware of it. I don't like the person I am and the mistakes I've made are killing me. Things I should have said or done seem obvious now, I've been a non player character and now I don't exist, I've isolated myself from adult social society and achieved nothing. Worse than being hated I'm indifferent to people and will be able to disappear un-noticed. 

My friends are building good lives and happy relationships, they're good people who deserve everything they've worked for and I'm happy for them.

I walked out with the rain falling on my face In total dismay

Smokey plumes float past
Is it relatable toxic?
No, I need oxygen
to clear my own path

I watch the clouds give way
And wonder if like the sun 
I will get a lucky break

I feel the heat begin to melt
My own friend who's whispered me help
Starts to dissipate like a snowman on new years day

Has everything he said been a lie?
Every direction of his affection just to get me by?

But my friend is the one I trust
This lady was nice but I never felt that she steered me right 

How could she? We've only just met
Now I've got to break down our walls
Just because its for the best?

Ha I get it man im depressed and this is a test of my faith to you
my friend you know me best

For Every hurdle that fell, 
For every story I tell, 
Our memory unfurls
for every step through hell

I couldn't begin to tell you how much shit you put me through too. 
I can't remember if it was for the best for me
or the best for you.

Every doubt in my brain you made so I could refrain from showing myself off again

But maybe they are right
I shouldn't listen to you anymore
We lone wolves but now I take my advice from and subscribe to a different pack

Breathe its ok, you feel like a robot and its just a phase they say
To me it's just another locus within the plague

I find myself on this high-rise and try as I might I can't hear your voice

Its void vs void the choice is the same

I can chose to make myself happy
While others are burdened with my pain
Or I can be the reason there's still a smile on everyones face.
So I sway, and I sway.

I miss you buddy, always deep within the caves of my mind
Right or wrong what you instruct made me feel insanely safe

And now I've forced you away
I feel more pain than everyone claimed I have

Now I've got to think of a future where your not there
And I have to admit I'm feeling
Pretty scared

The normality of reality
Is grim but I must bare
And the silence is just not fair

Goodbye my friend
You've done nothing good for me
Or so they say so you must leave

Is this the feeling of ok?
It must be!
But this world I've been dropped in
I don't properly trust it

And now my knees are buckling
Apparently my mind is clear
Everyone says I'm on the road of mend
But deep inside I'm still suffering.

All because you are not here
The whispers are gone
The silence is deafening
I'm a different man
Because you were forced to leave me

We've been told to take it one day at a time
You dissolved into the caves of my mind
While I strengthen mine
I just hope we see each other on the other side
I'm just waiting for the other side

734,ReddyReddit91,3,"Hi People!

Since the age of 12 (15 years ago), I've always just felt the need to want to kill myself. If anything goes wrong it's my instant thought process. I'll think of something I did that was embarrassing- I just want to die. Money problems- I just want to die. Mistake at work- I just want to die.

I now say it out loud and I'm worried that it's also turning into a tic or a form of tourette's. I've even resorted to slapping myself around the face to stop any thoughts.
 
Obviously I have my good days but they are only a 24hr 'high'. At most I may have a couple of good days on the bounce.

I work 5 days in a somewhat pressured job which I am quite good at. (Other days I think I'm shit at what I do and the spiral happens again)

I have ultimately given up any hope of trying to match my relatives (they all have their first homes and high paying jobs) and now live literally as the day comes. I'm also worried about the fact of letting people down and I can't keep up with them. The only thing that really gets me out of bed in the morning is the fact I don't want people to think I'm not a hard worker.

I feel hopeless by the day. The worst part is that I feel I don't deserve this. Not in the sense of that I think highly of myself but in the sense of that there are people who've had such a hard life and upbringing. I feel that if I sort out help I'm actually stopping someone who needs it far more than I do. I couldn't live with that guilt.

I've been a good person, never had to worry growing up either. Surely I'm just being too sensitive?

As you can imagine, my chest started to go mad and I made the decision not to go and apologised profusely. Once my girlfriend and MIL left I got my favourite beer, my favourite cigar. After halfway through I calmly decided to have another go. Walked up, tied my belt to my window and around my neck. I was giddy with excitement. As I started to pulled down in was so ready. after suspending for a minute, I let up. Calmly unravelled everything, picked up my beer and cigar and just carried on about my day.

746,Richte36,6,"Throughout the years of depression I’ve had (from mid teens-now to late 20s), one constant I’ve always heard was how it will get better or how something will change. 

That’s always what people say who don’t know how to deal with things like this or don’t understand what it feels like to feel like a reject or useless. That made me think of something else. It’s that people aren’t willing to admit that some people just will never have it all, or even what they want. Unfortunately, as I’ve learned all too well, life isn’t fair. As I’ve come to think of that, that makes me think of the people that say it’s selfish to commit suicide. While that’s another post for another day, the people who say it’s selfish are the ones who have what they want and don’t deal with depression. We are not guaranteed a good job, a relationship with someone you care about, a family if you want that, or even tomorrow. Those of us who struggle with depression know this. We want it to get better, but we know we are not guaranteed something better by the way of life. We are not guaranteed to get better because we see a counselor or take a daily antidepressant. Maybe this is what we are guaranteed, because if we also had it all, the whole world would be happy and that’s not how it works. 

We never asked to be brought into the world by our parents, and never asked to feel like a pile of shit that can’t get out of bed some mornings. It hurts like hell to be in a place like this, especially when we know that we are not guaranteed a fairy tale ending like we read in books when we were kids.

I think I’d currently say it would be better to not exist, since it seems as if nothing will change, and there’s no point of this. I don’t want to just exist. I want a life that has pleasures to enjoy it in, and a day or two away from the constant emotional pain.

804,SirReadsALot92,0,"One of my best friends suffered from depression a couple of years ago. Both she and I were university students back then. She was a gregarious, outgoing kind of a person, probably one of the most beautiful and kind hearted human beings I have ever seen, until  depression took over her body and soul, literally. It all started with a breakup. Her boyfriend broke up with her, with whom she had shares 4 years of her life, and she took it really bad. 

She and I were pretty close as best friends, so I saw how she changed, rapidly, during two three months. She stopped coming to university, she stopped talking to all of her friends, she stopped talking with her parents (even they lived in the same house), started drinking, and started having sex A LOT. As I've mentioned before, she and I were pretty close, so she never stopped talking to each other. Sometimes, she would call me at night and cry, saying all the things she'd done during the day, places she went, stuff she'd done with the men she randomly met. It was shocking, I was devastated but there was nothing I could do. I suggested therapy and stuff but she strongly refused them. I was scared that she would stop talking to me too. I was the only human connection she had in her life.

Final shock came when she called me one day at 3.00 am in the morning. She told me that she didn't know where she was, and that she couldn't walk. She had had sex with 4 guys with she met in a bar somewhere. They had taken her to someplace in the middle of nowhere, used her and left her there, unconscious. When she called me, she was terrified. I talked to her for like 5 minutes, calmed her down and asked her to find her location using her phone and send it to me. When I finally reached that place, she was behind some trash cans, crying, scared and half naked. Fortunately, there was no physical damage done.

So the following day, she and I talked a lot. She cried and cried and cried. Good thing was that, she was scared. For the first time she admitted that she needed help. So we  did get help. I took ger to a therapist, her mother was really helpful too. The journey towards recovery was never easy. My girlfriend thought I was having an affair with her, so she left me (that was okay though, it wasn't going anywhere anyway). It was totally worth it, cuz my friend was back to her usual self after 8,9 months. Even though therapy helped her in some ways, what helped her the most towards her recovery is that (in her own words) - having my friendship and her mother's love. 

If you're suffering from depression, this is my advice for you: People are rude. Most people don't care about who you are and what you do. But if you truly want to get back on your feet, you need to find someone that you can count on. You need to find someone who supports you, all the way through. If your family isn't there for you, go out. Talk to friends. Talk to people. Not everyone will listen to you, but someone will. Humans are by nature extroverts and being alone is not going to help you. This is not your battle to fight alone. There are people out there, who would fight side by side with you. You just have to reach and ask for help!

Take care!!",9/22/2018

878,TheLifeisgood72,6," Spinal fusion from T1–L1. Essentially my entire spine is immobile.

This has affected my energy and mood greatly. If I go into certain positions, sometimes just random ones, I have insane pain spikes that completely destroy me. Not to mention mild discomfort basically 24/7, never something someone should live with.

My social life has faded. Into basically nothing. I don’t know why but my personality has changed since this surgery and nobody likes me anymore. When I got back from my surgery I had people screaming with joy and calling for me to ask how my surgery went. People genuinely liked me. Now? 0 texts over break, nobody really likes me and people say I’m like a zombie or not right in the head. It’s because I’m not. I feel like my old self is gone. I feel empty inside. The only peak of happiness I’ve felt in these past 13 months was when I was talking to this girl. She said I was bad with girls to one of my friends but would still go out with me because I’m “cute”.

Eventually I had up and decided that I’m just not capable of making a person happy or feel emotions because of my pain. Now I get snapchats of her dating one my old friends every day...

Now I’m in an even deeper hole than before. I’m utterly alone. Even people that are aware of my disability don’t give me time or even care. People always nag on me for not being good enough at basically everything. I feel no hope in life and feel like my old self is gone.

My only hope is getting the hardware from the surgery that is causing the pain removed. People online with similar pains have told me that it does not make the pain go away and could result in my spine collapsing, again.

I don’t give a fuck. I’m not living like this for the rest of my life. I’m on pain meds and they still do nothing. I hate myself from top to bottom. My free time consists of procrastinating homework and playing video games. I went out with friends once the past 13 months and... it didn’t go too well.",12/11/2018

I couldn’t barely speak to anyone without being in pain. Do I had the hardware removed, and now the curve is coming back. But it’s worse because my spine had its growth stunted. So now I have a spine that’s too small, curved, and painful. Every day that passes is a day wasted. I’m tired of all this bullshit. I just want to make friends, have a girlfriend and live a confident life but that’s impossible thanks to these fucking doctors that have fucked me over. I’m going to have to live like this for the rest of my life. I’ll never be a normal looking person. My arms hang down to my fucking knees. They act like this isn’t a fucking issue. My torso is going to be 4-5 inches short than it would’ve been. What the fuck. It kills me inside thinking about it. I’m fucking disabled thanks to these fucking surgeons. Give me one reason not to end it. I want to hire a hitmen and murder my surgeon. I know this isn’t the only teenager he’s done this to.

I lost everything. Every day was miserable after that surgery. I had 2 metal rods and 23 screws in my spine. My body rejected them. I lived in pain for 24/7. Like stunning your toe, you know how your mind feels agony? I felt that 24/7.

I lost everything in those 15 months. All of my friends. All of my online friends left because I no longer had the motivation to play. I couldn’t talk to my friends without being awkward because my mind was too preoccupied with the pain. My grades plummeted due to depression, right now I’m not passing any of my classes but I don’t care. For the first time, I feel like an normal person. Im still severely damaged mentally but I feel different. I feel better. The past year of my life is a big blur, I don’t remember anything or what happened. Looking back, I didn’t play any video games or hang out with any friends. I really don’t know what I did those past 15 months. I guess I just rotted while I stressed out about my social life, my body, and my grades with no real way to fix them.

I wish I could have those 15 months back. I had a large chunk of my life robbed. I’m still not fully recovered but it’s miles better. I think. I hope. Last few days have felt really good.

I protested to even consider carrying on as a brain dead corpse just to survive. Can you imagine a more unfortunate and miserable life sentence? Then for a long time, I went back and forth between successfully burying myself- and then unearthing myself in a panick, melting down over the misery, protesting again.

Something I always told myself I would never let happen, something that was more special to me than anything, maintaining the colors of my mental planet, I stopped and I let it all become pitifully buried and it became...easy.

892,ToyboxOfThoughts,3,"Here's why. Everyone will tell you nice positive things when you say something as generic as ""I'm depressed,"" but just about every time you actually honestly dive into the REASONS WHY, suddenly no one gives a fuck about you any more. So here's a specific reason why I KNOW I am never going to find like minded people to socialize with.

All my most important need-to-relate beliefs are all the extremely unpopular ones, and most of them alienate eachother. To explain what I mean by that, one example is that I am vegan, AND prolife. Both things I am very passionate about. Both things where I can't really fully relate and be myself around people unless they agree. Problem is, the vegan crowd tends to be extremely anti prolife and will attack the fuck out of anyone who mentions it, while the vice versa is also true with mentioning veganism in a prolife crowd. Before you say ""yeah okay just find people who are both,"" it's not that simple because I have a lot of other examples like this that basically cancel out my ability to relate to or be comfortable around literally anyone. Before you say ""wuhl you just need to lower your standards and stop being so stuck up not everyone is perfect,"" shut the FUCK up because OF COURSE I could do that, but what would be the point? I wouldn't really even feel comfortable around the person, let alone excited to hang out with them, nor would they really fully understand me either. Whenever I dampen my real self to fit in or I ignore things about others that make me feel alienated from them, I just end up feeling ten times as hollow and alone than I would feel being ACTUALLY alone.

It’s hard to say why.. but my goto to ‘getaway from things’ back then was to get on my bike around dusk and just ride, ride anywhere for hours and forget about all my problems whilst listening to music.

For some reason, I wish I could still do that. To just physically exert myself to the point that I didn’t feel my mental stress anymore, it faded into the background because of the burden my body was taking. I got better and better and pushing myself certain distances and speeds in order to ignore my depression and get away from things.

I’m stuck inside because of the agonising amount of schoolwork I have. And then once I’m finished it’s so late all I want to do is stay in and play games, binge youtube, jerk off.... and go to bed. Repeat. Nothing is fulfilling in my life. 

I try, I really do, to plan social outings and to stay fit. You’d think both of these things would help combat depression. Dead wrong... eventually, my motivation for both of them always goes away, to the point that I wonder why I even bothered with them in the first place. 

Meeting friends is the worst, and yet I need it so badly. I just want someone I can talk to about everything, without being made fun of. I’m at a stage in my life where I am being surrounded by death (close family dying or sick) and stress (academic/financial). 

I’ve always thought of myself as someone who was pretty good at handling depression, but recently it’s really been affecting me. Lot of friends who just wont take the time to even message me, or will decline any sort of social activity I propose.

Gaming, going out, talking to friends, even listening to certain music or watching certain movies...  gets me depressed and nostalgic for the times when I used to find these hobbies ‘fun’ at earlier points in my life.

It’s probably because when I do these hobbies now, I’m reminded of how happy I was back then, and how little I’ve come now. 

Just recently I began connecting with some old friends and playing games with them again. It really reminded me of the times a few years ago, when everything was so much simpler. At the start I was super happy I got to experience this again, but now I just can’t bring myself to enjoy it. It’s like whenever we play I’m constantly thinking of happier times whilst simultaneously constantly comparing myself to them and how far they’ve come.

You miss your family and you think, well, I can stay with them temporarily and then find a job, and find an apartment, I'll star over and it'll be fresh.

Well think about the things you have now that you won't have later:

- apartment
- (car?)

Yeah maybe that's all you have. You don't have friends, or a job, and you literally never leave the house, so you may as well move back in with your family, right? You miss them, they miss you, after all, you don't want to miss out on those life experiences, right?

Well, sure. You'll see your family. It'll be nice. For about 6 months or so. But guess what, you brought your depression/anxiety with you. So you're still not going outside. You still don't have a job. You're not really socializing with them as much as you thought you would, and they're getting a little frustrated with you (even if they don't say it). Your siblings keep inviting you out and you're still depressed and riddles with anxiety so you always decline (you *do* go out sometimes but you always end up feeling worse somehow). 

So now you lost your apartment, (your car?), and without realizing it you also lost your independence, and your dignity! They'll never say it to your face, but they think you're pathetic now. 

OH! Probably the worst thing of all: Your brain activity will decrease to about 5% of it's normal capacity. Yeah you'll feel like a literal vegetable. Not only that but you will literally start to feel insane after about 6 months. Once you hit the 2 year mark, you're basically dead. That's right, you killed yourself when you decided to move back.

God damn it. Why cant I fall for a girl who's good for me?,7/7/2018
1256,ineedanewthrowawy,1,I dont know why I'm not stronger. I cant be with the girl I love so I purposely end our friendship because I cant take the back and forth. Then I purposely fuck up whatever I had with the girl who loves me even though she knows i dont love her. On the same night. I know it hurt both of them but it really hurt the second girl. I just tried to cut myself for the first time in years and the fucking knife wasnt sharp enough to get in there without possibly going too damn deep. I drew blood but it took some sawing without risking real damage. Fuck me it hurts now though so I guess I got what I wanted in the end. I feel like such a piece of shit. I need to just end things and everyone would be better off but I cant. I'm too scared.,7/16/2018
1257,ineedanewthrowawy,0,"I'm so bored all of the time. When I'm working, all I want to so is come home and play a video game or go and have drinks with the guys. When I'm home, I dont want to do anything. I'm not interested in anything anymore. I miss a girl a whole fucking lot. I cut contact with a new girl who was willing to love me because I just couldn't love her that way. It feels like I'm just coasting through life now that I have no one to love and no one who loves me. I wasnt happy when I had her but god damn do I miss her so much. I dont know what to do. I have friends, I work, I'm going to school in the fall. I'm just fucking empty. I almost want to text the girl I cut contact with but its messed up to talk to her just because I'm lonely, when I'll never feel love for her. Sadness doesnt describe it. Obviously depression is more the absence of emotion. But I feel extremely down. I care about nothing. The only thing that ever makes me feel better is drug use. What the hell do i do? What can i do? If I could have one thing in the world I would want the first girl back. At least I didnt feel so lonely with her. Fuck me. I'm hopeless. ",8/3/2018
1258,ineedanewthrowawy,4,"I know its unhealthy in more ways than one, but one of the ways I deal with my depression is using nicotine. I quit smoking cigarettes and now all I use is a juul.

I can handle the cravings pretty well but then I'll have a down day and I just break bc I dont care. ",8/24/2018

So easy to pull myself out of this mess and enjoy life. And then shit happened, like it tends to. I guess I could say at least I know it's possible to feel better now? But without her? I never found ANYTHING that made me feel like that before her. How long will it be before I find something else? I wonder what will win the race here. Drug addiction? Or will I find that spark that makes life worth living in something or someone else? Every day is I fight for me to not go get wasted or high. I'm always on the lookout for pills but I'm not the most social guy around these days. I could say that's a good thing, but damn do I miss the painkillers. I'll quit bitching now. I can take solace in the fact that I'm still a functioning addict rather that the dysfunctional kind. I'm still taking the steps towards success I started when I had her in my life. I'll be alright.

I miss the physical contact that was so comfortable with her. How right it felt to spend the day with her and come home at night and not feel like I wasted my time. I think I miss the intimacy more than her honestly. But i never had that with anyone else so I associate that feeling with her. I know she wasnt perfect, I dont believe we would have been happy forever had we stayed with each other or anything like that. It would have been nice to try though. Fuck this emptiness. Being alone used to come naturally to me. I have to find someone else I feel like that with. I dont know how much longer I can go through this life alone.

A few days into talking to her again she explained that she used to think I was sort of stupid back then, but now she can see that I'm actually pretty smart, and she believes I'm probably quicker than her.  It's kind of nice to know that once she got to know me, she thinks that of me. But it made me fear that my vacant look and apathy due to my depression lead people to believe that I'm a dumbass. I'm not trying to say that I'm a genius or anything, but I know I'm not dumb. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I dont want people to think I'm an idiot when the truth is im just fucking empty and cant always express emotions. Maybe people think that, because I'm kind of blank, that means I dont process what's going on? I mean, I have made some fucking stupid decisions in my life so it's true on some level. Whatever, i know i can learn things and pick up new skills so I guess it doesnt matter. It's just been bugging me since she told me that. I worry that it will affect my ability to get a job in the future but maybe my qualifications will convince employers otherwise if I do well in school.

For whatever reason, my relationships just never seem to work out. I wonder if it's because deep down I'm dead inside? I've tried the approach of hiding that, and of just letting it be out in the open. That being said, the girl who I let it be known to actually did want a relationship with me. That time, the problem was that I wasnt into her. Theres always a fucking reason that either I cant do it, or the girl I like cant/doesnt want to do it.
 I'm so lonely that I cant make myself do anything anymore. I mean, I still go out with friends, I still take care of my responsibilities like work and school. But when I'm home, I do nothing. I cant even make myself play a video game. I just watch Netflix. 
It hit me today that I really miss the last girl I dated. I think it would have worked with her had it not been for several reasons I wont get into here.

She said she would as soon as she got the chance and I thought ok cool. Today i find out shes blocked me. She told me shed be there if I needed anything important, and i thought i respected that pretty well.

I go and get fucked up then i come home and try to squeeze some study time in. I cant quit getting drunk these days and I recently bought cigarettes for the first time in 6 months. I think I've slipped into what may be the worst my depression has gotten so far without even realizing it. I take care of my responsibilities but I do it as a shell of a person. When I come home I'm all alone. Theres kind of a sad afterthought here and there but I push those away effortlessly now. I know that confronting those feelings isnt helping this time around. It's been 2 fucking years and I cried a lot of times. It never feels better. Not this fucking time. Whatever I need to get off my phone and memorize this speech even if it takes all god damn night.

Everything I've been hoping to a god I dont believe in will happen. My life doesnt suck so fucking bad anymore. Within a second of me saying, ""yes??"", I find out it's my boss. She lost her voice and needs me to bring in some paperwork I forgot to give her right away. I got over there and she told me I sounded surprised on the phone. I tell her I thought it was a girl I knew crying. My co worker laughs, ""hahaha he thought you were one of his hoes!!"" I laughed too, ""haha yeah..."" and I left. That bummed me out so fucking bad.

The hate I feel towards myself and the things that have happened to me in the past is unbearable at times. When I do finally go out on my own, alone, I will likely decide to end it. I feel a sense of impending doom because I know this is what comes from being alone for me. I pray to a god I cant fully believe in that I find a girl that I can be honest with.

Mom, I cannot even try to understand the way you are feeling right now, same as no one could even try to comprehend the way I felt and why did I do what I did. I need to let you know I love you with all my heart, and it was that love what kept me going for so long. I am sorry I am writing this in english, but for some strange reason I feel I express myself better this way. It is strange, but so was everything in my life.

Tell my brothers I love them, that it is my true hope they can find happiness and the courage to live through any fallback they might experience. I wouldn't want them to feel the way I did.

In regards to him, even now I will not sugar coat anything. I hated him, and felt a profound resentment towards him. I fucking despised him.  It was not because he wasn't a good and loving father, it was because of his pathetic genes that unfortunately I inherited. They were the reason I hated my existence, that I was deprived of a normal and fulfilling life. I was a monstrous person with zero physical appealing...How could such a beautiful woman get together with someone so pathetic? That is something I never understood. You deserved better, and so did I. I was never given a chance in the game of life, just a project destined to failure from the start.

I had no place in this world, this was my objective, observable and irrevocable truth. What I needed in life to be happy was simply out of my reach, and it was so wired within myself that I just couldn't let it go. I wanted to feel what it is to be loved and desired, a simple glimpse of that reality.

The only thing I wanted in life was the chance to be happy, but the world didn't think I deserved that chance. How could I have kept going when the only thing that mattered to me was unattainable? When everything else turned to ashes in front of my presence?

I was done being unhappy due to things out of my control. My only mistake in life was being ugly. There was someone really special within me worthy of being loved, I could see glimpses of him from time to time, but nature is always more powerful and I couldn't escape the curse of this shell.

All of this might sound selfish to you, but you were not there to experience the constant rejection, the pain I had to endure. You see, I tried to have hope, to open myself to the world, just to end up being crushed by it every time. 

Do you think it was funny to be ignored by someone you have feelings for, whom you tried to give all your attention and help along the way? Do you think it was funny to find out this person thinks nothing of you and would rather be with someone that doesn't really cares just because of his looks? You will be surprised to find out the amount of times this happened to me.

You know how heartbreaking it was when I had to hear women talk about how good looking a guy was in front of my presence? I was never that for anybody, I just wished they could see me with those eyes...Nobody ever looked and thought of me that way, it didn't matter how much I tried. 

I got tired of seeing others find happiness and enjoy their lifes while I was left in constant sorrow. I was heartbroken by default, that was my natural state, the one nature intended for me, unchangeable. I was sick of it, with no desire to make it further.

You cannot begin to imagine how bad I felt about myself when I had to go to work every day and hear people talking about their lifes. I had absolutely nothing going on for me. They exuded life while I exuded loneliness.

I had to isolate myself, otherwise I would have perished before. I was a piece of meat rotting in the street, no chance for me to be happy. 

You might wonder why I didn't ask for help or talked with anybody about this. It would not have made a difference. I was sick of everybody feeding me platitudes, messages of hope that the world then proceeded to shatter. No, personality didn't matter, nor was I able to find happiness on my own. They would have said I was just depressed...no, I was just aware of a reality I couldn't face anymore. 

There is no point in trying to fix someone that is already broken beyond repair.

I couldn't stand being ignored anymore like some kind of subhuman. Every one of this last days I went to bed hoping to never open my eyes again, and when I did, I felt a soul crushing pain within my heart.

Every man has a breaking point, and I had reached mine. It was time to learn to live without love, or to die from the lack of it, and the first option wouldn't do it for me.

How could all have been in my mind when I asked the world the right questions only to receive the same answer every time?

John, you were the closest to a friend I ever had (how sad is that?). Those stupid conversations we had meant everything to me, even if hearing about your life was a constant reminder of what was missing in mine. You are awesome, and I love you man. You were given a precious gift by life, and I hope you can see and appreciate how lucky you are. Keep living to the max as I know you have so far. I was not training a teammate, I was training my replacement.

You...you were the spark that lighted the dynamite. Someone so beautiful you shattered my heart with your mere presence. I had to see you every one of my days, and it was a torture. Is there anything worst than dreaming about something you know will never come true? Like a mirage in the desert you were out of my reach, not part of my reality as much as I tried to get your attention.

I loved you in my own weird and strange way. Maybe you wouldn't recognise it as such, after all I didn't really know you, but those small gestures and meaningless conversations were my stupid way of expressing my feelings. All I wanted was for you to see me in the same way I saw you, but nature was a barrier that I couldn't overcome. You didn't, and I came to understand no one ever would no matter how much I wanted to. I was not good enough for you and I don't judge you because of it...most of the time I was not good even for myself.  

I hope you are really happy in life, I really do, someone so special is always meant to shine, to live and experience what I couldn't. I want you to know you have nothing to do with this, no influence over my decision. On the contrary, I am thankful because you opened my eyes and made me face my crude truth.

What was in me to bare? To share? To inspire and fall in love with? I only pretended to reach out because of my insatiable desire and loneliness. I had forgotten how to be human a long time ago. The standard parts that are supposed to be there in people, in me...weren't.

I forgive you for causing so much pain to my heart, I forgive you even if there is nothing to forgive. You didn't deserve any resentment from my part, you had done nothing wrong even if at some point I wanted to see it that way. Once I told you I just wanted to see you happy, and it was a truth that I standed for, even when it made it harder for me to let go. That smile and laugh that filled my heart with momentary joy sufficed to me.

I wish I was a better and stronger person, but this was all I had. There was nothing else in here for me. There was too much beauty in this world, but it was not meant for me.

I was already dead. I died with my hopes of feeling loved and desired, with my chances of being normal emotionally and physically, with every one of my crushed dreams. All left was an empty shell drifting in an unforgiving world shoving constantly what could have been, what life was meant to be. Doing this was just my way to fulfill my inescapable destiny. 

I didn't know how I could keep waking up in the morning knowing that even when I tried so hard to make myself happy, there were essential things I couldn't achieve. I felt so spent, so unmotivated, so lacking in a future...yet the time I had left on this earth spanned onward unfathomably. You cannot even begin to imagine how haunting and hard was for me to want to open my eyes when I knew I would wake up to nothing but the unachievable.

Everything could have been different if only I was able to change my appearance. I fantasized about this all the time and I knew deep inside it was my only obstacle to achieving what I really wanted in life. And it was painful to acknowledge that something so banal, so out of my control, would be the end of me. It was sad to realize that my only alternative to this curse was eternal nothingness. I was trapped with no real options, running on empty, no way out. 

Everything, every single word, movement, interaction, attempt and action shattered my heart, and there was nothing more to break in there. It was pure agony.

I just wanted to fit. I craved normality, simplicity. That comforting feeling of finally belonging. To know I was worthy of being loved. It was not possible, not real, I wasn't like them. Perhaps I just didn't deserve to, and I don't know why. 

I was very weary, though my tears did not longer flow. My eyes were tired of weeping and my heart sick of woe.

Please respect this decision, and forgive me for all the pain I have caused to you. I am really sorry, this life just became too much for me to bear.

Be good guys, and remember that I love you. Don't suffer because of me, I am finally in peace, or at least I hope so...If there's damnation, I think I know exactly how it will be, and I will feel right at home.

I will always be in your hearts if you think of me, not the person who has just left, perhaps that little child with hope in his heart that someday I was...I don't know, a better version of me, just remember me that way.

Only in death we will be equals, nothing but shadows and dust. ",4/20/2019
1296,jfruedam,1,"I opened my heart to you thinking it was time for me to be brave for once, and you couldn't offer more than your friendship. I don't really know why I did it, deep inside my heart I was more than aware I had nothing to offer you: nothing to share, to care, to inspire and fall for...

Still, the thing is, you see, you will never be just a friend to me because I will always think of you with different eyes. It kills me inside because I know that is the only thing you can offer, the only thing you see of me. It is too hurtful just to be around you having this feeling shoved inside. Behind the smirky smile I put up with there's an indescribable sensation, like if there were a needle through my heart, as if my blood was constantly burning. Just trying to cope throughout my days while condemned to admire and adore your unfathomable beauty, that is enough punishment for a lifetime. I fear no hell or damnation, I am already on mine.

Never fall for someone while being depressed. It is like carrying two worlds at once. Never thought I could be in so much pain, like if it was bursting inside me.",5/2/2019
1297,jfruedam,0,"Knowing that my physical appearance is the root of my depression and lack of willing to live. I am condemned. There are simply no ways to overcome this. Any other thing I could try to change it, handle it somehow: poverty, abuse, stupidity...But this I cannot, my face will always be the same; Exercise to keep fit? A haircut? Nice clothes? Being there, done that, it was like putting lipstick on a pig. I cannot change my nature, nor the way others perceive it, and that validation is my only objective: to feel desired and loved, worthy of affection from someone of the opposite sex.  

If only it was something else, anything, but why this? Self love won't do it for me, neither friendship. I am 30 now...another 30 of this loneliness? No, I cannot accept that reality, I have decided not too. And with each year that passes it will be 10 times harder.

1298,jfruedam,1,"I just finished writing my suicide note for the people I work with. Finished the one for my family a couple weeks ago. They are the only ones besides relatives I have any kind of relationship with, so just felt proper. Now is just a matter of when I will do it.

Guys, It is too damn hard for me to try and express what I want through just this words, but this will unfortunately be all that is left from me for you, and by now you will probably know the reason why.

Working with you was both the most amazing and torturing experience of my life. You made it amazing by being you, but I turned it into torture by being me. 

I never thought I could care so much about other people in my life as I did. Maybe my actions reflected a different thing when I was just not able to hide my inner demons; but I need you to know that I valued you all deeply with all my heart. 

I felt the luckiest person in the world for having been given the chance to share some memories with you. Every single missed opportunity, every mistake in my life was totally worth it, because it eventually led me to this job, to amazing friends, to soul crushing loves, to colorful characters I never imagined will be part of my life. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

John you are awesome and I am glad you know it (no narcissistic pun intended). You were the closest to a friend I ever had (I know how sad that sounds), and I thank you for that, for being by my side the last years. In all honesty I admired your life, even envy it. Spending time with you was awesome but extremely exhausting because you were a constant reminder of what was missing in my life, what I needed to be happy. I wish I had even a fraction of your self confidence. Your way with words, the easiness you approached people with,
the way you made those around you laugh, that required a special kind of quality, and nothing of that was a part of me even when sometimes I tried to fake it. At the end of the day, confidence requires to be built over a strong foundation, and I was walking over quicksand.

Keep living to the max as you have done so far; there's too much beauty out there that needs to be appreciated, I would hate to know someone like you equipped with nature best tools won't be capable of.

I was not training a teammate, I was training my replacement.

Matt, what a character you are, and I say it in the best sense of the word. Never did I meet someone so passionate about what he does, so cheerful, so willing to give his best no matter the obstacles in the road. There was always a smile on your face even when there was nothing to laugh about. I thank you for trying to cheer me up, to share your energy with me, and I am sorry most of the time I couldn't respond to that. I know sometimes you felt I had something against you, and I am so sorry for that, I had nothing but a deep respect and admiration for you, and I wanted to be your friend, I really do; but, the thing is, the closer I got to people the more lonely I felt, the more inadequate and worthless, so I had to keep my distance, it was my only alternative. So whenever I was grumpy, or in a bad mood, please understand I didn't want to, I just was extremely tired of putting myself out there only to get cut down and have my heart and spirit undermined every time.

Steve, thank you for giving me the chance of being part of this team, my life turned around for better when I started working with you; up until that point I felt I was beyond hope in regards to my professional self.You took me under your wing and had the patience to teach me about what we do, and I grew up with time to become the person I ended up being. I am greatful to say I could see you more as a friend than as a boss, such a strange thing. You are a great leader and it was a pleasure working with you. 

Julie, we never really had the chance to talk much, and I really regret that because I tthought of you as someone with strong convictions, not afraid to speak her mind, someone warm and caring. Those are traits I would always have wanted in a friend. I thank you for listening me when we had those conversations, I am really sorry I was not able to follow your advice. 

Caroline, it is too difficult to know where to start when writing about you, my heart just keeps beating faster as I think of you...I was bewitched by your beauty from the moment I met you, and bewildered by your presence every one of my days. Everything about you exuded life, and I couldn't more than admire and fall for the person you are. I wish I had the chance to know more about you, but I understand there was a insurmountable barrier between us (that's just the way nature is, unalterable despite my efforts). 

I am sorry for feeling the way I felt about you. I don't really know how I might have been perceived by you; a creep? a weirdo? a pathetic man-child? an ugly annoyance? It really doesn't matter. All I know is that somehow it was uncomfortable for you, a burden you didn't ask for, and it hurt me just to think about that.

And even though it hurts me, you will have to forgive me for not wanting to keep this emotion inside, for being selfish one last time. You see, people might think it would be weird or ridiculous for me to say that a part of me loved you, but to me it felt just like that. I guess love has a different meaning for everyone. Wasn't it love when I taught you about what I do? When I shared my personal work notes with you? Those small gestures, those meaningless conversations we occasionally had were my stupid way of expressing my feelings, they were acts of love for me. I just wanted to see you happy, your smile that filled my heart with joy sufficed to me. 

I am really glad I had the chance to meet you, of admiring the beauty this world was capable of, even if it was incredible hurtful only to withstand being around you. I wished with all my heart I was someone good enough for you to notice, but I was simply not. Can there be a worse nightmare than dreaming about something you know will never come true?

Be good guys, I will miss you too much. Just know that I only want the best for you. I am convinced of your success in life. Your future is bright and full of opportunities, please cherish them. And if you ever happen to think of me along the road, I beg you to try and remember something you might have perceived as good in me, not the person that has left you. 

You are exactly where you are supposed to be, and so am I. 

Vodka for Steve. No need to explain.
Pistachios for Julie. I know how much you like them.

1299,jfruedam,3,"The company I work for is holding a summer event party next Monday, and I am really hesitant to go. Why? I feel like a worthless piece of shit already, I don't need to be shoved down my throat how much better others are: 80% of them are handsome chads with fun personalities, I am not joking...picture that. No, I don't want to see the girl I have feelings for laughing and enjoying herself around them, remembering me I am not good enough for her. That image would haunt me for too long, not letting me rest, making me curse my existence.

On the other hand, is it weird that a part of me still wants to go even knowing I will end up hurting myself even more? Am I a masochist? I just crave human connection so much. I don't want to be categorized as the weirdo, the bitter guy who hates everything. I know they think that of me somehow already; if I don't go, that would be their confirmation. I would hear them talk about how much fun they had at the party and I would feel more left behind than I already do. They will be laughing, I will be alone crying on the inside.

Isolation is my only defense mechanism, and is hard even to use it without feeling like trash, because reality is I don't want to be alone, I want to be happy as they are; but if I don't, I will fall deeply into despair...I feel helpless.",6/15/2019
1301,jfruedam,2,"To me it is strange and terrifying  that someone like  you can make me feel such a variety of  deep emotions...some good, others not that much. At least now  I know my heart can still feel  something. Who are you and what force brings you to my life? You are an angel and a demon, a dichotomy I cannot explain. Coincidence? Destiny? That illusion called God?  The Devil?... I don't know where you come from and at this point it really doesn't matter anymore, because you are here and will become another tortured memory of my life, even if I don't want it that way. 

It's not your fault, you just live and enjoy your life as any normal person would. For you, i'm just someone else of this huge world, an acquaintance you interact with because the circumstances obligated you. I wish you could notice me for something more than that, but that's an utopia.

Contemplating your cold view that contrasts with your warm smile while we have those futile and inconsequential conversations has become one of the best moments of my days.They are a great joy and a deep sadness at the same time, they enlighten my day and make me think about all the beautiful things in this world...but are a nightmare because there's nothing worse than dreaming with something that will never come true. 

I wish I could be a better person, someone that you found interesting enough to give a chance, but I cannot change who I really am, I don't have that power.

Sometimes I wonder what you really think about me, I wonder if you notice in my look the way I feel, if you perceive the smile that I cannot stop or hide when I see you, or the way my heart fills with joy everytime I can make you laugh.

You are like no one I know, a beacon from another world with the energy of a thousand suns, and  a glimpse of your attention would mean everything to me.

I should have never met you, because even if you don't know  it, you have hurt my fragile heart and keep doing it. You  made me feel something I thought I wasn't able to anymore,  but I am afraid you will be my point of no return, and my  heart will now turn forever into dark coal.

It hurts me to try to let you go, but it hurts more to hold on to my idealized picture of you. I wish I could get to know the real you, but I understand there is a barrier between us you will never let me cross. I'm not good enough for you, and I don't judge you because of it...most of the time I feel I'm not good even for myself.  

Behind this pathetic shell there's someone that is perhaps worth of knowing, but I cannot make you or anyone else look pass through it...I'm hopeless against human nature.  

You have everything I don't,  and are everything I am not. You are quite  the opposite of me, so if I hate myself, how can I do  something more than love you?

I wish I could tell you how beautiful and extraordinary I think you are, and make you smile, but I fear the weight of your rejection. You are a unique gem in an otherwise underwhelming world and you deserve to be acknowledged as such.

You are a drug I don't know how to quit, my best dream and my worst nightmare.

I know some sports are on that I would typically watch but I know I’m not actually going to be able to pay attention so why bother watching. I’ve started doing research on different projects online to see what the future might look like. I really don’t care about the things I used to. My car and place are getting dirty and messy and I still have no desire to clean them. Hopefully I look back at this one day and laugh.

Now it’s over and a little more calm than I was when I was in the relationship but I still have lasting effects like trauma and depression. I started thinking a lot about just not wanting to be alive anymore. I recently saw a post on here saying that people don’t want to die, they just don’t want to be alive. I am developing a numbness and I am worried that it’s going to make me not care about anything forever and I’m going to lose my job because of it. All due to being broken. Trying to recover has been a lengthy process and I’m sure I’m nowhere near complete. All I really want is to help humanity and help people out to create a better life for everyone. I want to help develop a better tomorrow. Then I will be fine with dying. The idea of helping humanity is the only thing I have going for me. I can’t go to friends and tell them how I really feel and now I have gone 5 weeks without seeing my therapist. They are the person I can open up to. But I’m always skeptical and worried they don’t like me and will laugh at me, I feel like I can’t trust them and open up and cry.

So I don’t get a job because I’m so fucking crippled with anxiety regarding my capabilities/appearance/general distaste for social situations??? I’m sorry. IM SO FUCKING SORRY IM NOT ENOUGH FOR ANYONE.

I will do these things one day, very soon, when ive finishes my education. I will have to and if I struggle for a bit, that’s what makes us stronger right? 

But until then, I am making my own way, I’m getting help, I’m looking for opportunities &amp; work experience, I’m trying to build myself as a person. IM TRYING TO BUILD MYSELF UP.

I’m not great by any means, I’m an okay person, I’m kind &amp; compassionate and one day I want to help people. Isn’t that enough? Do I always have to do things by a certain timeline?? I’m 21 fgs.

Why can’t I push myself? Am I a failure? I have no one else. Everyone at home makes me feel like I’m worthless. I am, aren’t I? 

Good for fucking nothing. Even as I read this I feel like I can’t quite write what I’m feeling. I just FEEL NUMB. I don’t want to hate other people, I don’t want to feel less. I just want to be me. I just want to help myself become me, who I think I can be one day.

21,AllergicToChicken69,4,"First of all, I don’t have depression. I mean, I’ve never been to a doctor or gotten diagnosed so let’s just put that aside. Last week, my best friend of nearly 3 years commuted suicide. I don’t know how to feel about this. I’ve never lost anyone. Granted, we were online friends, so I never really got to meet him, but he was always there for me, no matter what. We could talk for hours. I was never tired of him. We told each other everything. I did the best I could to stop him considering he lives in Tokyo. In the end, he stopped responding to me messages or even reading them. He always answers me. I’m pretty much certain he’s go and it makes me sad every time I think about it. All the years we spent together are gone. I blew up at a friend of mine who said that I should be happy he’s dead because he was happy to die. But he wasn’t. He was miserable from the start to the end. I was so mad at her. I screamed for what felt like hours. In the end, I apologized. She did not. I’m starting to drift away from her. Anyways, the main point here is that I have been feeling very unmotivated lately. I hardly eat and I never leave my bed, and with his recent passing, it’s only been worse for me. I try to distract myself, but my thoughts always direct back to him, and every time they do I end up crying myself a river. Please, does anyone have any ways I can cope? I can’t talk to my parents about this. They wouldn’t like me talking to someone online. But I need to numb some of this pain. Please, please, please can someone give me ways to make this go away even a little bit? I can’t bear the thought of my best friend being gone for one more second.",6/29/2019

In school I went into pursuing my future career with certain classes because I am always thinking of the future. I was generally proud of my work before I started analyzing what it took to be a TRUE artist and photographer. That's when everything came crashing down and my passions began deteriorating. My art teacher had told me from the very beginning that my art could use improvement. I thought ""ok, just some professional advice, that's all.""

I eventually kept my mouth shut and when my problems became more significant (suicidal, cutting, dieting, body issues etc) I didn’t say a word because I didn’t want to get shut down by her. But when her son came to her with anything, she would give him her utmost attention and support through it, trying to help however she could. She would give him the shirt off her back if he needed it.

I thought it looked silly, saying something like “tune in to your children when they need to talk” or something.

424,RayDelMar_0,4,"Hi everyone. I'm sorry that this is long. I’ve been reflecting though about my overall life and where my depression likely stems from.

I've thought about some reasons I can’t seem to find anyone (friends, partners). I realized that throughout all these years I’ve been unable to truly “love” people. I’ve even had trouble bonding with my parents from the moment I was taken in. Hell, I can’t even say “I love you” back to family without tensing up or losing my voice. Whether out of the grace of my heart or in a romantic way, I just can’t feel those feelings of love toward people. It’s the reason I’ve never even tried to get a boyfriend and once I did, I broke it off before it even began. I suppose you could say I’m becoming numb to the outside world. I have no friends in real life, any opportunity for love I turn down because I can’t seem to let myself connect with anyone. I always feel like everything is my fault and that I'd be better off not intruding in people's lives, maybe even dying.

My stance toward real relationships is that they don’t phase me and I couldn’t care less about them. I’ve lost interest in human contact. As for empathy, I don’t think I’m utterly lacking, since I do incessantly apologize about anything I do to inconvenience people. It's like two sides of a coin and unpredictable. It's influenced me in ways where I feel like when bad things happen to humanity, I don't feel an overwhelming sense of sadness like I probably should. I feel like its deserved somehow because of everything we do to each other. It's kind of like how you might roll your eyes after watching two people drunkenly fight idiotically then knock each other out. But then on the other hand, if I do anything that can disrupt people's lives I feel like I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't own up to every mistake I made and basically kiss ass.

I don’t know why I can’t feel love for people or bond with them. I'm more afraid of them. All I see is the bad and when I decide to consider the good, it’s like the corruption of human nature overpowers it and I can’t identify a balance. I don’t know if any of this makes sense... I just feel like my own mindset is ruining my chances of feeling anything but isolated and upset. Theres just alot of darkness. I can’t decide if I even want people in my life anymore. A part of me still fears a future without friends or relationships, but then I feel like isolation is where I really belong at the same time. I'm so conflicted and overwhelmed. This life seems so pointless and seems to offer to me nothing but negative feelings and sadness. I wish I could block these thoughts but I'm deciding I guess, to just live with them for now. Sorry if it was too long. I'm sorry if it doesn't belong.",1/26/2020
