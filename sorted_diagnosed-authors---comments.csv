0,Ap-a-live,"I can relate to what you are explaining about the crushing existential emptiness. I feel the same way. But also to me all the therapy I had offered no solution. I am chronically depressed and I don‘t know how to get out of it. But what I find in therapy is that it is very much focussed on things we must alter or process. But there is also good parts in every life. So at the moment I am focussing on my strengths, on things that do me well. In many healthy people I have seen that, that they ignore all the bad stuff and just focus on the good. So hopefully it will work at least a bit.",1,2018-05-22
1,Ap-a-live,"I also do that sometimes. I just say „I am angry and need time on my own“. But when I am doing work with somebody, then I can‘t just walk off. Also it needs quite some time to calm down.",3,2018-08-09
2,Ap-a-live,Exercise seems not to help me much with anger. But yes more outlets would be good. I just have no idea where they could be.,1,2018-08-09
3,Ap-a-live,"That is an interesting idea, thank you! What I should probably focus on is to get angry about things that do matter. But in relationships with other people I find it so difficult, because for years and years I have trained myself to suppress my emotions thinking, because I am always afraid what other people think of me.",1,2018-08-09

5,Ap-a-live,I get where you‘re coming from. After years of blaming all the problems on my weight I also had to realize that my weight never was the problem. It has more to do with low self confidence and other unsolved issues. Anyway what I can assure you with 27 you are still very young and life will have a lot of good things still waiting for you. I truly wish you only the best and I am sure that one day you can have a relationship and family if that is what you dream of.,2,2019-06-22
6,Ap-a-live,"The same for me. I tried to open up to them, but they didn’t seem to be interested. One friend even said that everyone has problems when I tried to tell her how bad life has become for me. So that made me think that none of my friends are supporting me and support was what I needed at the time. Do you plan to contact some of your friends again?",1,2019-07-18
7,Ap-a-live,"Maybe that is not what you wanna hear, but I am really happy for you that you are out of that relationship. If he is messaging you all night and treathening to kill himself that is no fun anymore and I think it is better for you not to be in such a relationship. About the gym I really think he should have contacted you, but obviousley he had no interest. Try to move on and be a confident single. You will find somebody else and it will be so much better!",1,2019-08-29
8,Ap-a-live,"You really need to see a therapist. You aren‘t crazy but in a lot of distress and you need help. I wish you all the best, it will get better!",1,2019-09-13

10,Ap-a-live,"I had a similar situation when I told my friends that I am really bad. One of them just sad „well we all have problems“. Since then I cut contact, not because I decided to do so, but because I couldn‘t keep up with meeting up anymore as my mental health with ocd and anxiety totally went down the drain. Today I still don‘t have contact to them and I am very alone. I am better again and I would like to have friends but there is just nobody there anymore. So maybe you can tell your friends that you just need to sort things out for yourself and that you don‘t want to give up friendship with them. Because being alone is very hard.",1,2019-11-24
11,Ap-a-live,It is just so difficult to not give up. I am also just so alone.,1,2020-04-01
12,Burneracct1270,The past month the only song I’ve been listening to is seigfried by Frank ocean. The song makes me more sad but also gives me a little hope just because how beautiful the song is. I’ve never felt more emotional connected to a song or piece of art before.,2,2019-05-17
13,Burneracct1270,"I can’t afford a semester off. It’s pretty shunned upon in my family/community. Also Feel like taking off a semester would only further my spiral of bad feelings. I know I can handle school and it’s stress. I don’t see myself as someone who isn’t capable enough to handle school, just that I wouldn’t feel accomplished taking time off. Also, Seeing all of the friends I did have at school enjoying themselves and graduating before me would hurt so much. 

And in terms of using my camera, I consciously know I should pick it back up because I really enjoyed it, it helped me make many friends, it helped me feel more accomplished (due to being in galleries and stuff). I felt more validated when I was taking photos. But, I’m always second guessing if I only enjoyed it because I received validation. Then I fall into the same loop of questioning if I’m doing this for myself or for other people’s validation and a false sense of security. I don’t feel confident anymore because I have these types of thoughts day after day. I feel like everyone else is living through me and no decision is my own. 

I used to feel so much more confident about how I dressed, my personality, my hobbies, my academics, and all aspects of my life. It feels like it’s getting worse like it’s an infection just picking at my brain making me hate everything that used to make me happy. I feel this sense of escape when I’m asleep or high. And I recognize both these things as self destructive but they are the only things that give me any hope anymore. Seeing my mom used to bring me joy and hope. She is the most beautiful selfless person on this planet. But now I just see her and think about how much happier and less stressful her life would be without me in it, if I was never born. 

This turned into more of rant than answering your question. Sorry. Thanks for reading and responding though. I feel less alone.",2,2019-05-18

15,Burneracct1270,I have seen a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have started taking antidepressants and seeing a therapist. It’s just I am from a immigrant family and no one really understands depression and thinks it’s just a switch I can flip and make my life better. It’s not that I want to be depressed or so bad in school or even worry my family. It’s a fact if if I feel so unmotivated to do anything like how I used to feel. I feel like I’m living in a wax figure and I just wanna spark that wick and melt away.,1,2019-05-27
16,CubistIvy,Mostly because I’m too scared to actually kill myself. But I love my family and I have rescue animals and I sometimes think about what they would think if one day I just wasn’t there. ,1,2018-05-31
17,CubistIvy,I feel the same way that you too. I’m not sure if it’s less or more lonely to sleep next to a boyfriend every night who either doesn’t care or doesn’t understand. Sometimes I find watching people on YouTube feels less lonely especially at night. I really hope you find happiness xx,2,2018-05-31
18,CubistIvy,"You just perfectly explained how I’m feeling. It seems like the people around me who haven’t experienced depression first hand don’t really understand that once it’s happened it can just creep back in at any time or that when things are bad self harm always feels like a release. 
Anyway, I got prescribed meds about a year ago that didn’t work at all. I tried three different types and all of them had no affect other than giving me constant headaches so I just gave up on that idea. ",1,2018-05-31
19,CubistIvy,"Don’t worry, I feel the same way. I guess it’s hard for people to understand that it’s more than just ‘overthinking’ and that we’re not choosing to drive ourselves mad thinking about all the reasons someone did a certain thing. I guess the most frustrating thing for me is that I can feel myself doing it and I know that it’s probably nothing and I’m being irrational but I just can’t stop myself until it snowballs out of control ",2,2018-06-01
20,CubistIvy,This is so relatable. So often when my boyfriend doesn’t text me good morning or good night my mind just jumps to ‘he doesn’t care about you’ or ‘you’ve done something wrong’. It’s awful and I don’t know how to stop it. ,2,2018-06-01
21,CubistIvy,"Right? Sometimes I feel like I’m super difficult to be friends with or be in a relationship with because I remember every little thing that the other person probably forgets as soon as they’ve said or done it. I used to thing that people who don’t remember things as much as I do just don’t care, but maybe it’s me who’s strange. ",1,2018-06-01
22,CubistIvy,This is exactly how I feel. It seems like my highs and lows are so magnified and I can’t just be somewhere in the middle. It’s always one extreme. ,1,2018-06-01
23,CubistIvy,Sometimes I’ll go out or being with someone helps but I just don’t know what to do when I’m at home and alone ,1,2018-06-24
24,CubistIvy,I always make sure. Thank you :) ,1,2018-06-24
25,CubistIvy,"I don’t know what my triggers are. Being in loud setting with a group of people that made me uncomfortable triggered my first panic attack in a long time and I guess to feel some kind of control I self harmed. Once I do it the first time I just can’t stop. It’s been a daily thing since then, just every time I feel alone or sad. I just can’t fight the urge. ",1,2018-06-24
26,CubistIvy,I feel this so much. My boyfriend has a huge family and they do Christmas lunches and secret Santa and all that and although they’re not super super close they still all come together and celebrate. They’re so nice and invite me to things and try to make me feel included but I can’t help but feel like I don’t belong there and wonder why can’t I have that with my family. It’s very selfish and it sucks. This whole month is just shitty. ,1,2018-12-21
27,CubistIvy,Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to write this. I think I’ve reread it at least 9 times today. Thank you thank you thank you ,1,2018-12-26
28,CubistIvy,This made me sob uncontrollingly  I can’t remember the last time someone said that to me and it didn’t feel like an obligation. Thank you. ,2,2018-12-26
29,CubistIvy,My heart hurts for you. I hate that someone else feels like this ,1,2018-12-26
30,CubistIvy,I’ve seen a few in the last few months. The one I had before and really clicked with retired so I’ve been trying to find one that feels right but no success yet. ,2,2018-12-27
31,DeeGeeG,Oh my hometown is out in the country. In a more urban environment I can see how that could easily be taken over by jounalist,1,2019-03-14

33,DeeGeeG,I always thought about doing it in the woods. Even if you make a mess it won't matter because it'll take so long to find the body. ,1,2019-03-14
34,DeeGeeG,I've had spotty work history as well. I joined the Marines out of high school but got dropped in basic because of pneumonia and two broken ribs. After going years without any goal or plan and wanting to end it all one of my friends ended up talking me into going to tech school with them. I did well in tech school and got my GPA up. Now I'm at a college I've been trying to attend for 2 years. I may be old for this point in my life (25). But I guess it's a start as long the stress doesn't kill me. ,4,2019-04-08
35,DeeGeeG,Me. I've slept through my 11 AM class 3 times this quarter. I have 2 more before I get dropped from the class.,2,2019-04-15
36,DeeGeeG,Yup slept for about 20 hours yesterday.,1,2019-08-08
37,DeeGeeG,There's several times that I actually wish I could get sick so I could just take a break for bit.,1,2019-08-14
38,DeeGeeG,Once I had convinced myself that if circumstance hadnt improved within 6 months I was going to finally end it all. But then got to thinking about how my niece and nephew would handle it and how misunderstanding the rest of my family would be. For a while there in was living just for my family. And sometimes that's good enough as long as it gives you a chance to improve your circumstances.,1,2019-08-18
39,DeeGeeG,"I used to be this way, finally after 6 years, and a bit of alcohol, I finally dont care if I ever find someone.",1,2019-09-01
40,DeeGeeG,Hoping for the best for you. Thankfully my classes are only about 2 and a half hours a piece.,1,2019-09-03
41,DeeGeeG,Usually I'm fine with it. But these past couple days have been rough just too tired to really want to talk to anyone.,1,2019-09-03
42,DeeGeeG,"I was supposed to have a private bedroom dorm. I might ask if I can get one as an accommodation, seeing as how it's almost impossible for me to get a full nights sleep when I'm sharing a room with someone I hardly know. Hell it was hard to share a room with my ex lol.",1,2019-09-03
43,DeeGeeG,I think that would be an interesting life style. I'm not a fan of hunting myself but I find fishing relaxing.,1,2019-09-04
44,DeeGeeG,"I appreciate it. I've got to say, this subreddit has been the most supportive one I've ever been in. I believe I can get through this I just need a day or so alone.",1,2019-09-04
45,DeeGeeG,"Conversation can be draining for people with an introverted personality. I'm the same way if I go to a social event i usually need at least a day to recharge. 

I understand, I'm very passionate about art work, movies, animation. But people aren't usually interested in the technical side of it, they just care if they enjoyed it or not so our conversations about them usually end pretty quickly. That one was a bit easier to fix when I started going to one of the top film schools in the US because everyone is interested in the technical side. It's honestly been super easy to make friends back at school.",1,2019-09-04
46,DeeGeeG,The quarentine just keeps getting longer and my friends just keep drifting further away,1,2020-04-08
47,DeeGeeG,"On one hand I understand where you're coming from having been diagnosed with MDD a couple years ago. On the other hand I've felt like this for about 13 years. I obviously wasn't diagnosed with it back then but it was still the word that was usually thrown around to describe  it.

Maybe you shouldn't describe yourself as being depressed if your not diagnosed but sometimes there isn't a better way to describe it.",1,2020-04-10
48,DeeGeeG,I've told my psyches that I've consistently thought about suicide for most of my life as well as having come close to attempting on multiple occasions. Even told them my plan so that no one would find my body or at least that itd look like an accident. Never had police come for me or anything. Your docs are supposed to keep that stuff confidential.,1,2020-04-10
49,DeeGeeG,I feel that as I'm in the same boat. I've posted a couple times with maybe 1 reply telling me the same things everyone always says. But sometimes it just helps to vent.,1,2020-04-10
50,DeeGeeG,"It hit me once I began my medication and realized I'd still have bad days or sometimes weeks. This shit's been going on since like 2007 and I'm positive it never will get better. I'll never be able to trust people, never going to stop pushing people away. Hell, I'm in a down week now and here I am at 5 AM on Reddit because I cant sleep.",1,2020-04-10
51,DeeGeeG,"I feel that. I've been feeling invisible lately. Friends ignoring my messages, posts getting no reply or anything. Was wondering for a while if my account had been deactivated and I didnt know or something. It's not like it matters, but it compiled o top of already feeling an invisible loser gets to me.",1,2020-04-10
52,DeeGeeG,"I had to read an article about this the other day which recommended I take one of those dumb depression quizzes. Scored like an 89 or something, saying I have MDD, like tell me what else is new.",1,2020-04-10
53,DeeGeeG,I havent felt like playing any of my games riding the motorcycle anything. Getting up for zoom meeting for class is more of an annoyance and I'm falling behind in them all. Just wish everything could go back to normal.,1,2020-04-10
54,DeeGeeG,"Shit, I just want someone to borrow it and get all my issues sorted and get me back on track.",1,2020-04-19
55,DeeGeeG,I didn't either until you put me on the spot just now lol.,2,2020-04-20
56,DeeGeeG,I kind of know they would probably just shrug it off. Not the death itself but the part about killing yourself. But I wonder how it would affect them when they're older. I wonder if they would think its fine to use that as a solution or if they would be more prone to suicidal tendencies.,2,2020-04-20
57,DeeGeeG,"I can't count how many times being an uncle has saved me from myself. These kids are all under 5, how would my brother explain to them why they're uncle is dead without lying to them. The thought of that and their reaction breaks my heart. So I continue to suffer to save them from suffering.",1,2020-04-20
58,DeeGeeG,"Thanks, ill see what I can do",1,2020-04-25
59,DeeGeeG,"I canceled all my therapy appointments for the time being as I hate talking on the phone, especially for an hour at a time.
I've been on this medication for a while without any issues, probably about 8 months. It just with everything changing and feeling different in my social life. Just having a hard time coping with always being second best.",1,2020-04-25
60,DeeGeeG,"If you feel like you could have made something good out of your life, do it now. I'm 26, have dealt with MDD like 14 years or something like that, that was when I wrote my first letter apparently. Ive gotten a diagnosis and medication since then. When I got dropped out of the military that was the lowest point I had been because thats all I wanted to do all throughout high school.

Anyways, I'm definitely older than I should be for the point of life I'm at, but that's fine. I've still got another 20 years ahead of me, I feel like I probably will die in my 40s due to some stupid very unhealthy shit I've done, but thats besides the point. I'm in school now. One of the top art schools in the US as an animation major. I've swapped between Architecture to film and then to animation.

My point is, all you can do to make something good from your life is to start it. You don't have to have it all figured out right away. Some progress is better than no progress. This doesn't even have to be through school, maybe let your manager know that you would like to apply for a promotion, if they don't allow it maybe apply somewhere else. I know Publix in the US is good about helping people who want to move to management, and their store managers make bank.

Or if you're like me and feel like you've lived an unhealthy lifestyle, start to change it. I may still hardly ever eat but I have started working out at least.

Idk take what I've said here into consideration, but also with a grain of salt as I'm still often lost.",1,2020-04-26
61,DeeGeeG,"Let some shit get to me and probably fucked up what I had with a girl k was falling for, probably for good this time. If this wasn't becoming a pattern it wouldn't be an issue. Everytime I feel I can start to trust people again and feel like nothing k can say to them wod make them think differently of me I get shown why I shouldn't trust people. 
Ontop of that were basically in finals and I've been too sick the past few days to even work on them, and haven't been sleeping properly. 
I'm just so tired of these miserable desperate patterns. 
If I were to go jump off the parking deck for example I wouldn't want my parents to get stuck with my student loans or motorcycle payments. 
Dammit, I've gotta ""get up"" for class in an hour and I haven't even slept yet and still feeling sick as fuck.
I guess all in all, I'm just tired of this life and all my failures.",1,2020-05-19
62,DeeGeeG,You said it. So much simpler in like The Sims where you can die from sadness.,3,2020-05-28
63,DeeGeeG,I couldn't even if I wanted to. To afraid of how it would effect my family.,1,2020-05-29
64,DeeGeeG,I'm too much of a coward to do the work myself,2,2020-05-29
65,DeeGeeG,"For me it always comes from feeling like I'm second best at everything or fail at everything from jobs, to romance, to friendships. Never anyone's first choice. But, anyways, for me, it affects my confidence. If I fake my confidence successfully and for long enough usually it helps me break out of my depressive states. If that doesn't work then I'll usually begin working out. My depressive states come with a lot of anger mixed in usually. Working out when I'm mad is better for me and those around me.",1,2020-05-31
66,DeeGeeG,"That's a huge first step and I'm proud of you. 

For me, visiting a psychologist has really helped as well. If you feel like no one cares a psychologist can definitely help with that, it gives you someone to talk to on a regular basis who will listen and who does care.",2,2020-06-11
67,DeeGeeG,My posts here rarely get much traction. But just having a place to vent really helps me think things through.,1,2020-06-20
68,DeeGeeG,I don't remember the last time I had a dream lol. Maybe look at sleep as kind of a reward then?,2,2020-09-18
69,DeeGeeG,Yeah you gotta talk to a professional in the field. General health doctors might be willing to prescribe a temp fix because they don't get it. A psyche would probably be more beneficial.,1,2020-09-18
70,DeeGeeG,I'm better now that I'm on medication but I still have relapses. If I feel myself wanting to run away from other people or notice that I'm zoning out usually it means I'm already in a relapse or one is coming soon.,1,2020-09-18
71,DeeGeeG,I'm having the opposite issue right now. I've been up 22 hours at this point. Replying to Reddit posts is the only thing that has kept the thought of suicide out of my mind. I'm sor tired but when I put my phone down to try to sleep the thoughts come back. Yesterday was my birthday and we're supposed to be celebrating it today but I feel if I sleep now I'm going to sleep for 20 hours again.,10,2020-09-18
72,DeeGeeG,"I don't think it's bad necessarily. But also, in the same way as self medicating, you should probably speak to a medical professional.",1,2020-09-18
73,DeeGeeG,"Probably for the best, even if you are faking it, that could still be a cry for attention. Take care of yourself. 💛",1,2020-09-18
74,DeeGeeG,"The meds are supposed to help and they did for a few months. But I think they're not working anymore. Or at least losing potency. This girl approached me in one of our classes last year. She fell for me. It took me a while to fall for her though. But once I did I fell HARD. And Ill tell you what, since then I just can't stop fucking up our relationship. Which, I've discovered just recently, that depression affects your thoughts of what's right and acceptable in social situations. Which would explain why I said some things like that ""I didn't need her.""

It's really complicated lol.

So wait, did you and the guy ever see each other, or was it just like profile pics?",1,2020-09-18
75,DeeGeeG,"The first step is to not let pornography control you. Once you stop letting porn control your life you'll be amazed how much less you think about sex. I looked into NoFap and decided it wasn't for me, however I was interested in some of the benefits so I decided to cut back. I'll still look at porn occasionally but don't get off to it everyday anymore.",0,2020-09-18
76,DeeGeeG,I feel that. And I've thought that too. But at the same time I would love not having to fight my own mind to literally stay alive every other month. Wouldn't it be wonderful to rediscover who you are and what fills that gap instead? I think it would be personally.,1,2020-09-18
77,DeeGeeG,"Sounds similar to how I responded to a lot of situations after my military plans fell through. I think it's a coping mechanism, would rather feel nothing than feeling sorrow or sadness. As for zoning out and being in autopilot that could be linked to a depressive episode. When I start zoning I know that more than likely I'm about to go through a depressive episode, same with being on autopilot. I can not tell you what I've done this week cause I don't really remember.",1,2020-09-18
78,DeeGeeG,"You probably should go to a doc. Depression can be sudden, but usually, at least in my case I can feel myself getting low (wanting to isolate, not wanting to get out bed, sleeping 20 hours a day are usually the signs I look for.) For it to be that sudden and that severe you may have something more severe going on, not to scare you, it could be nothing. But I'd go to a doc.",1,2020-09-18
79,DeeGeeG,"Thanks. It's just weird cause we have a lot of fun when were together, so idk why she doesn't want to spend more time together.",1,2020-09-18
80,DeeGeeG,"I'm 26 well 27 now and still in school, so it happens. Been working on a degree since my military plans fell through, so like 8 years? Yeah I really need to take my own advice and just start slowly putting things away. It's just, I have so much homework. I feel like if I can pull myself out of bed it should be to work on that ya know? 

I feel like having a dog or anything that you have to take care of other than yourself is a great motivator to get out of bed. If I can remember to schedule another appointment with my therapist I'm going to ask about getting an ESA. Hell I've thought about getting a bonsai tree because they need daily care as well.",14,2020-09-18
81,DeeGeeG,"I went on medication because I've had suicidal thoughts on and off for 16 years. Which honestly don't seem like they're ever going to stop, only reason I'm up right now. It just kind of happened one day. I can't really describe it. I'm not necessarily happy with my appearance but I def think I could be worse off. I think talking to a new girl and exchanging risque texts and such helped a lot too. But I would not recommend that to anyone, it was dumb on my part, but the attention was feeding my ego lol. 

As for anxiety medication, it made me nauseous, and I already have virtually no appetite, so I stopped taking it. We were only trying it as a trial type thing anyways. And it did help a lot too, especially with talking to new people. Which helped boost my self esteem as well.",2,2020-09-18
82,DeeGeeG,"What's wrong? I'm not going to discuss my research on this topic, but I'm here to help if you need someone to talk to.",1,2020-09-18
83,DeeGeeG,Medication is a good band aid though until you can get to the root of the problem. I'd recommend getting him to see a psych and get him on some medication (if he's willing to take it that is). Then set up therapy. Men don't really talk about that stuff unless it's a controlled environment of their own choice. It took me nearly 12 years to finally talk to a professional about my suicidal thoughts.,1,2020-09-18
84,DeeGeeG,The only way to solve your problems (and end the mental health stigma) is to talk about it. I post here every now and then. It's actually probably my most interacted with subreddit. Usually no one replies but just being able to vent helps.,5,2020-09-18
85,DeeGeeG,At this point I feel the only person who would cry at my funeral would be my mother. Guess that's the power of never letting people get too attached. I don't want to hurt them so I try to avoid it.,1,2020-09-18
86,DeeGeeG,"I'm feeling that as well. Yesterday was my 27th birthday. Still is school, no girl to speak of for the past idk, 8 years? At this point. Had a girl who was infatuated with me last Winter despite having a bf. She stayed over a lot and we spent damn near everyday together. End of Winter quarter I was in a bad spot and stated something she did that bothered me. I don't think she ever really forgave me for it. I still tear up when I think about it and her crying over it. We hung out a bit over Winter break. After she said she loved me multiple times I finally said it back. And haven't heard her say it since then. Spring quarter I saw her maybe a total of 4 times. COVID and her bf didn't help because he's the controlling type who wants to be with her all the time and I don't like him. Not because they're dating, because he's generally a terrible person and has abused her before. Summer quarter she went home and I subleased her apartment. Now, the most recent long conversation was because I messed up a chair or something that was already messing up when I moved in. That was 4 or 5 days ago. And here I am lying in bed unable to sleep cause Everytime I close my eyes I think about ways to end my life. 

Doesn't help that yesterday was my birthday and I spent it completely alone when I just wanted to spend it with her, but I never heard back from her.",1,2020-09-18
87,DeeGeeG,"It could possibly help. I'm on Wellbutrin now, idk the dosage. I used to be worried about how I look but have just stopped recently. I'm not sure if it was the anti depressants though. I feel it was more my anti anxiety medication. Once I was able to break the wall of not thinking I was attractive though I haven't really regressed... At least not yet.",2,2020-09-18
88,DeeGeeG,My only advice would be do it as you can. Anything that is worth doing is worth doing poorly. It doesn't matter if you get all done at once just keep working at it. I just moved into my new dorm and already got a nest started. Would probably help if I had a trash can or trash bags. But I really just want to stay in bed.,155,2020-09-18
89,DeeGeeG,"Late is better than never, I say as I reply... 21 days later...",1,2020-10-13
90,DeeGeeG,My doctor is starting to think my depression might be drug resistant. He's recommended I try ketamine treatments but they're too expensive. I haven't been counting how many medications I've been on but it's probably around 15. I'm on 4 prescriptions right now.,1,2021-06-12
91,DeeGeeG,Literally me too. My earliest note that mentioned suicide and hating life was in 6th grade.,1,2021-06-12
92,DeeGeeG,Your support people would rather see you alive regardless so each out to them. I wish I had one to reach out to right now,3,2021-06-12
93,DeeGeeG,Idk ive been fighting depression for 15 years. I'm about at my end tbh,1,2021-06-12
94,DeeGeeG,"I'm supposed to be on Wellbutrin, Vraylar, Adderall, and Ambien. My prescription ran out on everything but the Wellbutrin and I find myself needing release multiple times a day. I've never been like that before. Like my sex drive has always been pretty normal I think, but now it's much higher than it usually is.",1,2021-06-30
95,DeeGeeG,I called the national hotline. They're taking me to a mental health pro I'm kind of freaking out though.,1,2021-07-09
96,DonRawiri,"You gave me a new idea, first I'll take a 4-5 day trip to an all inclusive resort on beach to try and reboot.

&amp;#x200B;

If that doesn't work then I'll take the month long trip.",2,2019-05-17
97,DonRawiri,"I don’t have any reason to complain, I just feel completely empty and hollow inside.

Yeah I do have a couple of traumas to get over, but I’m just so tired of trying different things and nothing seems to work.",2,2019-05-19
98,DonRawiri,"Totally agree, everyone leaves in the end",51,2019-05-19
99,DonRawiri,"For me it started as a way to feel something, anything, just a way to feel alive and in control.",2,2019-05-19
100,DonRawiri,"Good luck, and always remember this feeling for the hard times of they ever come back.",1,2019-05-19
101,DonRawiri,"Take a trip, indulge yourself in everything you want, just go wild with your most basic desires. If you want to do it after that, then at Lear’s you’ll know you tried everything.

That’s my plan.",2,2019-05-19
102,DonRawiri,"Similar place here, my initial plan is to take a short (4-5 days) trip to the beach or something similar, preferably with a female friend that I’m comfortable with (with my wife’s permisión) and see if that helps",2,2019-05-19
103,DonRawiri,"Same. The hollow inside is so dark, empty and with such mighty pulI that I wonder how some people go through life pretending everything is fine.",2,2019-05-19
104,DonRawiri,"I recently made a friend who’s been depressed for over 3 years, and when she shows me affection I do feel that, maybe because she gets what’s going on.

But I’m just more confused by that, I’m about to celebrate my 5th marriage anniversary.",1,2019-05-20
105,DonRawiri,I have a session in a couple of hours and it’s one of the subjects I want to discuss,2,2019-05-21
106,DonRawiri,"Same here. A friend told me recently that happiness is a 3 legged table, you, others and spirituality. And he told me that right now I have to focus on myself.

I’m still processing that and figuring out how to do it, but hopefully it will help someone else, check your other table legs.",2,2019-05-21
107,DonRawiri,"Ok, it’s 5:15 over here and haven’t done it in a couple of days but I’ll go now. Thanks.",1,2019-05-21
108,DonRawiri,"I’m 37 and I have the same wish as you.  The best I can do is cry for like 3 seconds every couple of weeks but it doesn’t help.

Hope you find your answers and I find mine.",1,2019-05-21
109,DonRawiri,"Everyone I know goes away in the end.

Yes, Johnny Cash version is awesome",1,2019-05-21
110,DonRawiri,"You should listen to Johnny Cash - Hurt

It’ll go very well with what’s on your mind",1,2019-05-21
111,DonRawiri,"I feel you. I’m in a similar situation, trying a bunch of meds probably not as many as you, but still no light at the end. So much effort, sacrifices and pain and it all seems for nothing.

I’m just hanging on one moment at a time. The thought question is, how long can we keep this up?",2,2019-05-24
112,DonRawiri,"A friend once told me: if you don’t feel like cooking, eat the ingredients separately.

And sometimes I just do that, eat the bread or the ham alone.",6,2019-05-24
113,DonRawiri,"I feel the same for the past month, what keeps me going is just focusing one day at a time, sometimes one moment at a time.

Just now, after not eating all day I just focused getting up and sitting on my bed, then getting myself to the kitchen, getting the ingredients out and making a quick sandwich, eating it and finally getting back to bed. It took a lot of me to accomplish this but it’s a small victory.

I rarely have plans beyond one day and by my psychiatrist instructions I can’t make important decisions yet. So I’m just getting by one moment at a time.",8,2019-05-24
114,DonRawiri,I have a body size avengers pillow I always hug in bed. I’m 37 and right now it’s one of my most valuable possessions,10,2019-05-24
115,DonRawiri,"Thank you, I know I’m in a really complicated situation, hopefully in a few months or a year I’ll get to post one of those “hang in there it gets better” posts.

Meanwhile posting and replying is helping to get to the next day.",1,2019-05-25
116,DonRawiri,"A friend told me happiness is a 3 legged table. You, others and spirituality. If you feel like that it’s time to focus on yourself.

I have to do that to, and I’ve been trying to wrap my head around how to focus on myself without being selfish or hurting others. You should look up some buddhism literature that talks about attachment. I’ve found a great article that helped me understand how to focus on myself but it’s in Spanish. I’ll post a link if I find something worth it in English.",1,2019-05-25
117,DonRawiri,"Yeah, but my doc says I’ll end up with the same kind of friends, partner, job, and I’ll end up in the same situation I’m right now. Maybe he has a point...",5,2019-05-25
118,DonRawiri,"It does actually, I started therapy again in January and ever since I just want to start over a million miles away. Leave everything behind and start over fresh. My doc says I’ll look for it will be pointless because I’ll search for the same things I have now, the same type of friends, partner, job, etc...

I’m hanging on but have no clue to what to do.",1,2019-05-25
119,DonRawiri,"I’ve been off work for about a month, my diagnosis includes panic attacks. So I’m officially on medical leave till I get better. Someone told me It could take a year, maybe more maybe less.",3,2019-05-25
120,DonRawiri,"Very similar situation even my wife agreed to an open marriage so I could do whatever I need to get better.

For me it’s chronic depression and anxiety, panic attacks and ADD. Everything just got worse the last 6 months and just contemplated suicide a couple of times, never attempted it yet.

I’m sure any advice I have you already have heard and tried.

I leave you with this poem, doesn’t help much but only to know that others have gone through it before us.

——

To Laugh While Crying

Watching Garrik - an actor from England -
the people would say applauding:
“You are the funniest one on earth
and the happiest one…”
And the comedian would laugh.
 
Victims of melancholy, the highest lords,
during their darkest and heaviest nights
would go see the king of actors
and change their melancholy into roars of laughter.
 
Once, before a famous doctor,
came a man with eyes so somber:
“I suffer - he said - an illness so horrible
as this paleness of my face”
 
“Nothing holds any enchantment or attractiveness;
I don’t care about my name or my fate
I die living an eternal melancholy
and my only hope is that of death”.
 
– Travel and distract yourself
– I’ve traveled so much!
– Search for readings
– I’ve read so much!
– Have a woman love you
– But I am loved
– Get a title
– I was born a noble
 
– Might you be poor?
– I have richnesses
– Do you like compliments?
– I hear so many!
– What do you have as a family?
– My sadness
– Do you go to the cemeteries?
– Often, very often.
 
– Of your current life, do you have witnesses?
– Yes, but I don’t let them impose their burdens;
I call the dead my friends;
I call the living my executioners.
 
– It leaves me - added the doctor - perplexed
your illness and I must not scare you;
Take today this advise as a prescription
only watching Garrik you can be cured.
 
– Garrik?
– Yes, Garrik… The most indolent
and austere society anxiously seeks him;
everyone who sees him, dies of laughter;
he has an amazing artistic grace.
 
– And me? Will he make me laugh?
– Ah, yes, I swear it;
he and no one but him; but… what disturbs you?
– So - said the patient - I won’t be cured;
I am Garrik! Change my prescription.
 
How many are there who, tired of life,
ill with pain, dead with tedium,
make others laugh as the suicidal actor,
without finding a remedy for their illness!
 
Ay! How often we laugh when we cry!
Nobody trust the merriment of laughter,
because in those beings devoured by pain,
the soul groans when the face laughs!
 
If faith dies, if calm flees,
if our feet only step on thistles,
the tempest of the soul hurls to the face,
a sad lighting: a smile.
 
The carnival of the world is such a trickster,
that life is but a short masquerade;
here we learn to laugh with tears
and also to cry with laughter.",1,2019-05-26
121,DonRawiri,"Yeah, sleeping wishing never to wake up. Anything else I take it one moment at a time.",1,2019-05-26
122,DonRawiri,I’m terrified of not knowing what to do if I ever feel happiness. Someone here told me that she had a breakdown because of feeling so much love.,1,2019-05-26
123,DonRawiri,"I’ve been binge hearing that song.

You’ll probably like Hurt by Johnny Cash",2,2019-05-26
124,DonRawiri,"I haven’t left my bed or couch in 18 hours for the same reason, really tired.

A friend actually told me I can’t burden her with my issues anymore, I get her because she’s going through something similar and it wasn’t helping. But I totally have the same feelings of reaching my quota with everyone else.",1,2019-05-26
125,DonRawiri,I hope at least it gets not so fucked up.,1,2019-05-26
126,DonRawiri,"Try just eating the ingredients separately, just the bread, just the ham. That’s what I have to do sometimes.",1,2019-05-26
127,DonRawiri,Hurt by Johnny Cash,1,2019-05-26
128,DonRawiri,"Oh my, I hope you get used to it. We’ll learn how to handle the good emotions too!!",2,2019-05-26
129,DonRawiri,I’ve heard stories of people with longer ones. My fear is not knowing what to do if I’m ever happy.,5,2019-05-26
130,DonRawiri,From 6 to right now about to turn 38. The last 6 months have been the worst.,5,2019-05-26
131,DonRawiri,"I just take it one moment at a time sometimes literally one step at a time, that’s how I got myself to the kitchen today.

I don’t know what else to do. If anyone has better advice we’ll both welcome it.",1,2019-05-26
132,DonRawiri,"I have people telling me I’m a great person, but I just don’t feel anything anymore. And they don’t really look me up and when they agree to meet it’s for short periods of time.

Everyone leaves in the end, so I wonder what’s the point to all this.",1,2019-05-26
133,DonRawiri,I think if I’m ever happy I wouldn’t know how to handle that emotion and I’ll just go back to the comfortable depression.,2,2019-05-26
134,DonRawiri,"Depressed since 7 years old, about to turn 38, the last 6 months have been the worse.

Hope everything gets better for both of us",2,2019-05-26
135,DonRawiri,"Drug dealers don’t care how you look, and I agree that it’s a better choice than suicide.

But what do I know, I want to kill myself too. What I know is that you won’t find advice on how to do it here and hopefully nowhere on the internet.",1,2019-05-26
136,DonRawiri,"I made it, but I know I have everything needed to start self-harming again after 15 years.

Tomorrow I see my therapist, hope to make it till then.",1,2019-05-27
137,DonRawiri,Want to vent or rant about it?,3,2019-05-27
138,DonRawiri,"I can’t promise a solution, some people find one, but everyone is different. Personally I’m getting by literally one moment at a time, and it’s so frustrating and tiresome.

I can promise that if you ever need someone to chat I’ll reply as soon as I can.

For me so far it seems that when one problem gets solved two more arises. Family, friends, work, you name it, it’s all caos.",3,2019-05-27
139,DonRawiri,"You are not alone, I want to kill myself everyday too. But first I’m thinking of taking a trip to somewhere exotic and indulge myself, just so I can say I really tried everything.",3,2019-05-27
140,DonRawiri,"Damn, that’s totally true, they only care when it affects their life’s or their status quo.

I just had a conversation with my mom and after 6 months now she cares. My wife started caring after I moved to the guest room...

It’s just so tiresome.",5,2019-05-27
141,DonRawiri,"I’m Mexican with chronic depression and anxiety, I get the whole machismo thing it works really bad both ways.

I’ll offer to meet, if you’re in Mexico City but my doc says I shouldn’t hang out with vulnerable people like me. But if you ever want to chat just hit me up.

Right now I’m on medical leave, and I’m trying to make people around me to understand what I’m going through but it’s exhausting.",1,2019-05-27
142,DonRawiri,"Damn, sorry no one has answered yet, I feel like that right now, I’m taking the car out for a drive around the city. That helps me because I have to focus on driving.

Hope you made it past your urges. Hope I make it through mine.",1,2019-05-27
143,DonRawiri,"I been wanting to separate from my wife since February but my doc has strict orders against me taking any major decisions like that, I’ve been going to therapy since January. When I see, hug or kiss my wife and literally I feel nothing. We actually sleep in separate rooms and have an open marriage arrangement for now.

I’m literally lonely, my brother moved away one year ago, my best and longest friend just moved. It took me a year to make the two new friends of whom I talk about. I’m not sure I can go through that again.",1,2019-05-27
144,DonRawiri,"I get it, I’m getting there. No energy and no point for most things, even a Reddit post.",2,2019-05-27
145,DonRawiri,I really hope that things improve for both of us. Or anyone going through something similar.,5,2019-05-29
146,DonRawiri,"Yeah, sometimes the frustration and tiredness of it all gets to a point when that only seems like the only option. I’m feel that I’m getting so close to my limit.",3,2019-05-29
147,DonRawiri,I’ll try to push it forward in time. Going on 32 years of depression. About to turn 38.... I’m just numb and tired of everything.,1,2019-05-30
148,DonRawiri,"I’ll try to push my date forward in time, but it all dependes on the meds and if there’s some kind of improvement",1,2019-05-30
149,DonRawiri,"You know how when you’re hangover or sick that your hole body aches and there’s no position where you’re confortable. That’s been life from me since I was 6, turning 38 in a few days.

I just want a life of not pain.",3,2019-05-30
150,DonRawiri,"I have the same plan. I have set a deadline (no pun intended) July 9, if nothing improves by then I’ll star traveling.",9,2019-05-30
151,DonRawiri,"One of the hardest things I had to learn this year was that no one is responsible for other people’s happiness, you are the only one responsible for your own happiness, once you come to terms with that the answer of where you should live will be an easy one to make.

If you want to know more about the subject I recommend reading some buddhism articles about attachment. That has really helped me out.",2,2019-05-31
152,DonRawiri,"I was thinking, when I used to have a bike one of the first things they thought me was to develop túnel vision, that is keep the eyes as far as you could see where you wanted the bike to end, the instructor told us that if you’re in a curve a suddenly you focus your eyes on a tree you’re going to end up in that tree. I asked how about small obstacles in the road, shouldn’t we keep our eyes in the road right in front of us, and he said that the road becomes a uniform pattern, and any obstacle will immediately stand out and then we deal with that.

Maybe that can apply to your case, even if you change your mind if you have a goal of where and how you want to be in the future keep focused on that, and all your actions should be helping you in order to achieve that goal.

For example I know I want to retire to a small cabin in the woods and spend my final years there, so my actions, specially the financial ones go towards that goal, I leave room for vacations and indulging myself, but I never lose focus of the main goal.

I hope some of it helps, I haven’t been in a situation similar to yours but that’s what I would try to do if I was in your shoes.",2,2019-05-31
153,DonRawiri,"I hope we get to respawn, I don’t care where just as we manage to get a better happiness score.",1,2019-05-31
154,DonRawiri,"I’m trying to reason it out, my plan involves a 4 to 6 weeks long trip and then if that doesn’t do the trick it’s the “easy way out” for me but then it will be close to cousin weeding and that would suck for her. But then again there’s never a “good time” to do this kind of stuff.

I’m going to therapy twice a week and taking like 6 pills a day, my hope is that some of that helps.",1,2019-05-31
155,DonRawiri,"Then let it flow, maybe you could make a career out of it, project planning or something like that!! Trust me good project planners are scare and in high demand. I’m sure you can spin it to your advantage!!",2,2019-05-31
156,DonRawiri,"I set a date in the future as a limit to feel better, otherwise I’ll set in motion my plan to end my life. Let me ask you, accepting this made you feel like taken a burden of your shoulders?

For me it was like knowing that some way or another the pain will not be there for much longer, and that gave me a bit of calmness.",1,2019-05-31
157,DonRawiri,"In my opinion you’re planning to far ahead in the future, I’m about to turn 38, and I don’t know how I’ll feel tomorrow let alone in a year.

Having a budget is nice, but for example just go for the clothing that you feel comfortable with at the moment, sure you might buy something you don’t want in the future and it’s the same with every aspect of life you’re bound to make some mistakes along the way. Just make sure to stick with whatever feels right for you and discard everything else, clothes, relationships, jobs, etc.

Let me tell you it sounds much easier than it actually is. But if you manage to pull it off you’ll find so much stuff about you that you never imagined.",2,2019-05-31
158,DonRawiri,"Hi, this is for both of you, my dad died on a car crash when I was 21 now 38, after a few weeks I found out it was no accident he planned to make it look like one.

That has become part of my depression and suicide thoughts.  Among several other fucked up things.

Hope things get better for all of us.",2,2019-05-31
159,DonRawiri,"Actually the doc sent me to get an EEG, they found that when I’m anxious the voltage on the left side on my brain is abnormal and that leads me to apathy. So maybe you have something similar.",2,2019-06-01
160,DonRawiri,Best I’ve done is placid.,1,2019-06-02
161,DonRawiri,"It took me 6 months and a lot of effort and energy, but I can honestly say that I have 1 really good friend and 2 friends.

I really want to be a better person for them, so they don’t have to worry about me. That’s something that’s really hard right now, it comes with it’s ups and downs.

Just yesterday was a particularly bad day, and one of my friends wanted to go out for a walk, thankfully it was raining so instead we ended up getting some dinner and then when it stopped raining I was able to tell her that I was too tired to go for a walk. She understood but it took me a lot to be able to express my needs.",1,2019-06-02
162,DonRawiri,My depression has me eating a lot less than I used to. I think that is one of the things I miss the most.,2,2019-06-02
163,DonRawiri,"A week ago I had to make her sit down, and listen to all her bullshit about how common is what happened to me (sexual abuse) or how she thinks I need Jesus  or just work harder. 

At the end it seemed like she understood, but yesterday happened the talk I posted about.

I’m trying to pull away from toxic people like her. But it’s very lonely because there’s only two non toxic persons in my life right now.",1,2019-06-03
164,DonRawiri,"A week ago I had to make her sit down, and listen to all her bullshit about how common is what happened to me (sexual abuse) or how she thinks I need Jesus  or just work harder.

165,DonRawiri,"Same, I set a date in the near future, if things don’t improve by then I’ll set my last plan in motion. It was such a relief, depression is still there with its full force but one way or the other it’ll go away soon so that does gives me comfort.",1,2019-06-03
166,DonRawiri,"I’m still trying everyday, just a bad day today, tomorrow will be better!",3,2019-06-04
167,DonRawiri,"Good advice, I already deleted Facebook a few months ago. My bday is around the corner and I’m dreading it.",1,2019-06-04
168,DonRawiri,Dad joke 100% although I don't have kids,1,2019-06-05
169,DonRawiri,"You want a hug with empathy and compassion.

I wished the same thing but a simple hug just won’t do it, when you get a hug from someone who accepts you as you are that’s when the magic happens.

I really wish that you get a hug like that soon!!!  Meanwhile I get how you feel, I see you and I hug you!",51,2019-06-05
170,DonRawiri,"My doc said feelings like that, I have them too, are because survivors guilt, guilt because the actions of others. And because of that guilt I had the urge to punish myself.

Maybe that’s your case. I have less guilt everyday but now it’s being replaced by anger.",2,2019-06-05
171,DonRawiri,"Your cat and sleeping will definitely help. 

My best friends is 7 days away from coming back from her vacation, and even though we chat everyday it’s a bit lonely just knowing she’s not a 15 min drive away.

Hope posting and commitment here helps time go faster for both of us!!",1,2019-06-05
172,DonRawiri,"Watch Boogie2988 videos on YouTube, the ones about his personal life, I’ll start with the draw my life video and go from there. Like he says if he can do it everyone can do it.

It’s been giving me hope for years.",1,2019-06-05
173,DonRawiri,"That is happening to me, for me it was because I was working with the idea of success that my father gave to me.

Right now I have to find what is success for me. I have no clue how to do that.",2,2019-06-05
174,DonRawiri,"I just hope days go faster, I know how lack of sleep can make a day feel like a week.

But honestly, will anything be any different if you were home?

Somehow I hope it gets better for you.",1,2019-06-05
175,DonRawiri,"I have none... 38M

how can one find one?",1,2019-06-06
176,DonRawiri,"Been there, done that, for like 30 years.... now I’m just numb.

If at all possible seek psychiatrist help, I finally went to one in January and it’s helping a bit.... one little step at a time.

Meanwhile let your emotions out, trust me, you don’t want them bottled up.

Virtual hug with my best wishes for you.",2,2019-06-06
177,DonRawiri,"Basically yes, depression can cause physical symptoms, for me it was general body aches, test did indicate that I had general body inflammation so I treated the symptom and let it go but 6 months later I crashed with severe depression.",1,2019-06-07

But right now It’s worse, I’m having flashbacks and I feel worse than ever.

After that if I still feel like that, I’ll plan a trip to Germany and/or Japan to indulge myself spend all my cash and credit and end my life after that

183,DonRawiri,"I’m sure you feel meh about questions and everything, I feel the same way, also since I can remember. My first therapy session was as a 3yo.

Four months ago a new psychiatrist sent me to get an EEG and it showed that my brain waves from the left side of the brain don’t work properly making me apathetic and emotionally distant. They gave a pill that I’m supposed to take twice a day for two years... still no change.

So here’s my question, have you ever had an EEG?",1,2019-07-02

190,DrewDaPrince,"I don’t know how possible trying to prevent being in a negative mindset is for you, it’s definitely easier said than done, but if you can somehow suppress those thoughts I would recommend you do that. That’s what kinda helps me. I’m sorry if I couldn’t help you in anyway, but I hope you can be happy again someday. Don’t give in.",1,2019-07-18
191,DrewDaPrince,"I’m in a very similar situation as you are, sometimes I feel I don’t deserve all the things I seem to take for granted and all I can think about is suicide. Now I’m not gonna sit here and say to you that things get better because honestly it’s entirely up to you. Try to make some changes to get rid of the unhealthy habits you may have from depression. They don’t have to be drastic, baby steps are fine too. I know shit can be pretty hard at times but you gotta keep going, for yourself and your loved ones.",1,2019-07-18
192,DrewDaPrince,"There’s a girl whom is extremely important to me, but she isn’t apart of my life anymore due to my mistakes. After she left I had proceeded to drop out of school and lost all motivation for anything. My only goal is to become the absolute best version of myself I can be and give endless amounts of love, support and to share a successful future together with her. But this seems impossible since she’s moved on a long time ago and is with someone else.",1,2019-08-11

194,DrewDaPrince,"What you say isn’t as important as what you do for them. Start with your friend’s short term goals, if they don’t have any then tell them to think of some.

195,DrewDaPrince,"Don’t let other people bring you down, you have to learn to ignore them. If that’s what you enjoy doing and it helps you escape then keep doing it, we ALL make mistakes sometimes that’s just apart of life. Hopefully you can get help or find whatever it is that makes you happy in life to beat your depression and stop self harming. You’re still very young and have a lot of time to get yourself together and I believe in you.",1,2019-08-15
196,DrewDaPrince,"I know it’s very easy tell yourself all that, I have similar thoughts sometimes as well, but you can’t keep beating yourself up like this. Having confidence in yourself is extremely important, doing nothing to improve yourself is going to do absolutely nothing for you. Set goals for yourself even if it’s baby steps, doing something instead of nothing is crucial.",1,2019-08-15
197,DrewDaPrince,"That’s great, I’m proud of you. I hope you can continue to have days like this and be miles ahead of where you are now so when that day eventually does come, you have those people there for you and also are able to just look at all things you’ve accomplished since then, ultimately having no choice other than to be happy.",1,2019-08-15
198,DrewDaPrince,"I feel the same, hopeless but I can’t give up for my family’s sake. I know times can be tough, that doesn’t change that you have to keep going. Set goals for yourself everyday, learn something new, take steps outside of your comfort zone even if they’re all just baby steps. Maybe you could find someone to lean on and hold you accountable for your actions. I know failure can be scary and very discouraging but everyone fails, we can choose to either learn and become stronger from it or let it consume us. I don’t know if things will get better for you, I truly hope that they do and you can the happiest you’ve ever been without having to worry about depression any longer. Don’t give up!",1,2019-08-15

Sometimes, when I’m having a really good time with friends and get happy I can feel myself become more aware of what’s going on around me. I can almost feel/see/hear things more clearly, literally. Like a high but it’s obviously not me being high, just kinda me “waking up” per say. How I was as a person back in the day.

You propably hear this alot, but looks are nothing you need to worry about, youll realise that some day. Looks are important if you are looking for a quick date, but believe me, most of the beautiful girls are just so shallow that in the end, when they are in their fourties, theyll realise that themselfes and feel absolutely miserable. Nobody will want them. Its so rare to find a girl with an attractive personality AND good looks. Some of the most popular guys in my school actually dated the, in my eyes, ugly girls and a few of them are still together after years. Find a passion. Set yourself goals you want to reach in life, and make the best out of it. Thats whats important, and that is what guys will find attractive someday. Some peoplejust aint meant for a relationship during school, and im one of them. Just get through school, that is literally the worst part, because you get all the wrong ideas about what matters in life. ",1,2018-09-21
202,Ganjanthegr33n,"Wow, thats basically how my life went down till now. Im 19 in a few days, ally childhood everyone kept telling e how gifted i am, how school should have been ez pz, how im so gifted and shit and how i have to do this and that. In the end i didnt graduate from the german equivalent to high school, but im lucky enough to have parents who just want me to be happy in life. (Even though we apparently have completely different ideas of happiness) i used to think it was all my fault for beeing lazy and stuff, for not fitting in but a recent and first time shroom experience showed me otherwise. Its not my fault for not fitting in a system that is as stupid as ours is, i know im not to stupid for the shit people want me to do but i wont have any motivation if to me, personally, it doesnt make sense to do so. and its really hard to break out, but thats the goal i set myself. Itll be tough, especially when your only support comes from your (loving) parents who cant see outside of the box, and to whom your ideal life is nothing but a joke.

Youll meet people who you have alot in common with, who youll connect too on a deeper level, but i dont think that whatever you are thinking of is real. I always felt like this, but i guess ""normies"" just dont think of this kinda stuff. I really only got this after a shroomtrip where my buddy just seemed to realise that, that life isnt this one big construct, that everyone is seperated in a way. That we are all secretly alone. What astounded me was that he appearently never had thought about this in his whole life, while ive been aware of that stuff since i was like 10 or something. Psychedelics however also show you how that really is nothing bad at all. Not advisi g ANYONE to take drugs right now, imjust saying that this stuff has amazing potential when handled correctly.",1,2019-01-16

210,Ganjanthegr33n,"Id like to study music. I just got a guitar Teacher again after years who will train me for the next two years. During that time ill do a (in german we have a word for the time i which you are trained in a profession) as a sound technician basically. Im really dedicated to putting in every bit of energy i have in learning my instrument, essentially doing what i never managed to do in school. Ive never been at a point in life where that was the case. 
I just feel like im an idiot for dreaming so high while more or less laying on my parents wallet. Im currently doing like a voluntary year, (im doing a job for like 3$/ hour) which i really like. But as soon as i get home thats gone, and everything is like always. Its just a really weird feeling of guilt i guess.",1,2019-02-06
211,Ganjanthegr33n,"Im glad if it made you feel better. I wouldnt have thought id view life like i do now. But thats the great thing, your views can change.

But just to be clear, dont just do psychedelics if youre deep in a depressed state. and dont do them alone, it can get dangerous. Prepare yourself a week in advance, do alot of reading about this stuff and talk to people on the psychedelic subreddits to make sure you go in there with the right expectations and mindset. Eat healthy, make sure you have absolutely nothing to worry about on that day, and just be the healthiest you you can be. Mentally and physically. Prepare some questions for yourself, write them down in a notebook to answer on your comedown, these moments where you write advice for your future self can be quite enlightning. Make sure you have someone you absolutely trust by your side who cantake care of you, and who knows what hes doing. (Doesnt need to be an expert trippsitter, just someone who wont freak out if you dont feel well) 

Be carefull, and let me know if you are going through with it. Id be really curious if they would have a similar effect on you like they did on me and my friends.",1,2019-02-06
212,Ganjanthegr33n,"Nah dont worry, it didnt. And yeah thats proably the best and exactly what they want. But alot of this stuff has to do with living at home at age 19. Feeling like my life is going no where, got dreams but neither do i know if ill achieve them, nor if i will still want to chace them in a few months seeing as i give up most things, beeing completely dependant on my family, knowing that wont change for quite a while, feeling like i should give up my dreams cuz its now too late to dream and time to get realistic, etc. Life just sucks in generall. Ill definitly be homeless sooner or later.

214,Ganjanthegr33n,"I know where you are coming from. But there are somany options, even though you might not see them. We are born and raised with this view on the world, that the way society runs is the only way one can live. You feel like thats all there is but dont realise youre trapped in your own mind.

I know this might sound like something that would come from a stoned hippie, but its true. The internet holds so many storys of people dropping out and realising theyr own dreams. Some live together with like minded people in a commune, some just travel the country on the back of a train. Some buy and live in a car wherever they want. These are some pretty extreme examples, but it shows that there is more to life. You can choose. You might have to sacrifice some things and perhaps burn the one or two bridges, but nothing in life is free.

Also, and this is just somehing id like to throw in there because i made the experience myself, but psychdelic drugs like lsd or psylocibin mushrooms show you exactly that.  They have incredible potential for people like us.
I do NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES want to encourage someone with depression to take a drug as powerfull as these, especially unprepared. But if you are not familliar with them, do some research despite the horrible things you might have heared. These drugs literally do exactly that, they let you see past the labels and systems our brain uses to interpret the world. They let you see the ""true nature of life"". Again that sounds very esoteric, but if you experienced it its just logic and youll ask yourself how you didnt see it before. They showed me exactly that, the endless possibilities my life has and what i wanted to do with it. They quite literally cured that part of my depression, the feeling how my life didnt make sense and shit.

Cuz the truth is, the way most people live theyr lifes DONT make sense in the slightest. You are looking for truth where none is. They are just content with beei g able to distract theirselves in their free time with tv, drugs, partying, etc. ",1,2019-02-06
215,Ganjanthegr33n,Yeah thats always the reaction i get. Its silly. Thats why i dont talk. Cuz every time we finish the conversation i feel like a priviledged whiny piece of shit complaining about nothing. Story of my life.,1,2019-02-06
216,Ganjanthegr33n,"I know its a stupidquestion, but why are you torturing yourself? Why are you living this life that others aim for but you clearly dont? ",1,2019-02-06
217,Ganjanthegr33n,"Yeah been there. Didnt help that i moved alot so i always was the kid who didnt know anybody. I realised the only way to stop torturing yourself is by not giving a fuck. I dont care about people anymore, or what they think. I got out of school and realised, people come and go. They dont care about you and you dont care about them. I stopped wanting people to like me, and as a result i found a hand full of people i have the same interrests in so we can bond over that. I dont have many friends but the ones i have are enough i guess.
I still beat myself up over it from time to time, but for the most part my social anxiety is gone. I dont get a pulse of 160bpm when i have to ask for the way anymore. If the conversation has a clear goal, i really dont mind anymore. Ive done it enough times to know i can be very calm and professional on a surface level. A few years ago when i started going out drinking with some friends i realised that i can be quite charismatic and good at small talk, people told me that directly, even without alcohol. But those are all times where i didnt overthink stuff. I was focussing on my life, doing alot of sports and was planning to go grab a few drinks or just hanging out with my friends. 
I feel like if you wanna socialise, you cant know whats gonna happen. You gotta plan on having a fun night, and see where stuff is going. I know this wont help,im still terrible with people. For the love of god i havent made a single friend since i got done with school 2 years ago, i feel like its gotten worse again. Dont really know what the goal of this comment was, i guess im just telling my side of the story.
I cant make or maintain any social relationships,
Never had a girlfriend, and im neither fat, ugly, small or dumb. I am a blonde, 1.87m, relativly ""athletic"" (not so mich anymore, but im working on it) guy, play guitar which apparently should give me +20 charisma with the ladies, and of average looks. And i still am an absolute mess. I even once was on kind of a date without knowing it, thought we where just having a great time, blowing the whole thing. My social skills are the fucking worst.",1,2019-02-13

I can tell you though, as someone whos done with school for 1 1/2 years, alot of stuff gets better once youre out of there. Life doesnt nececarilly get easier, but i feel like once youre done with school, you get a whole new perspective of yourself. Highschool is a terrible social enviorment, you you are constantly beeing judged and compare yourself to other people who literally have no impact on your life, but whos opinion still matters to you.",1,2019-03-07

I love playing the guitar and for some reason i can concentrate for hours practicing, i guess simply because i care.

They dont share your point of view, they just dont agree with your opinion.

Like i turned into the person whos not afraid to sit himself to a group of people and drink a few beers and just chill with them, but simply doesnt say much. Apparently people just perceive me as a really chill dude who they are actually comfortable with having around, however i just feel dead inside. Kinda weird how i did a complete 180 in like 2 years.

You are an arrogant elitist asshole, nothing else. No way of proving your viewpoint, or even explaining it, the only argument you managed to spew out is ""im right cuz youre wrong.

I only recently realised how this cycle repeated itself over and over and over again for years. Highschool was alright, i actually wasnt depressed once in those 2 years, but afterwards it all came back, and only then did i accept that this wasnt normal.

I cannot recommend prescription medications with the assistance of a licensed prescriber ENOUGH. They have helped me immeasurably. It takes a lot of time, but I no longer want to die, which is something I never thought I would be capable of saying.

Which I say not to try to shove my trials into your face, but simply to attempt to show that it’s not coming from just another well meaning person who is unable to understand your trials. 

Although I of course can’t fully understand your situation, but I hope to be closer than the average person perhaps.",1,2018-10-23
252,Generic_Userboi,"I would just straight up ask your therapist. Be as completely honest as possible and say that maybe you’re just self-diagnosing, but you can’t get out of your head the possibility you have depression. Ask if they are licensed to diagnose or not, and if not ask how you can know for certain. 

Even if it isn’t depression, it’s obviously eating away at you and has been for a long time. That alone makes it something you should find a way to resolve :-)",3,2018-11-11

254,Generic_Userboi,"I’ve wondered this many, many times. Thoughts like these are what stopped me from getting help for years. 

I grew up with a family member with very bad anxiety and depression, and while their symptoms were very externalized mine would often be internalized. I never thought anything was wrong with me, simply that I was lazy or a generally bad person. Whenever I did start to doubt myself and think that I was sick, my family or friends would quickly shoot me down saying how I felt isn’t depression because “We’d all be able to tell. You wouldn’t be questioning it.”

I would take “am I depressed?” non-official tests online, and even go through the WHO symptoms trying to find out for certain if I was. When I’d come out positive for depressive symptoms and behaviors though, my brain would tell me it was simply myself wanting to blame an externalized source for my own problems and shittiness.

I blamed myself for the unwanted thoughts I had of harming myself and others. I blamed myself for not being able/wanting to get out of bed. I blamed myself for not liking things anymore. I blamed myself for not being sociable. 

It wasn’t until I went and saw a professional and described my thoughts to them that I was told I have the one of the severest forms of chronic depression barring that which causes catatonia. 

Tl;dr— you are not your disease, and even if you were a ‘bad person’, you are still exhibiting the very symptoms that define depressive disorder. And, I’m guessing, you’ve been diagnosed. Meaning you ARE depressed. ",3,2018-11-11

259,Generic_Userboi,"Either way, it sounds like you’re in need of counsel. From what you’ve described though, I doubt it’s just “in your head.” I’ve been diagnosed with 4 severe mental illnesses and still feel that I’m making them up sometimes; its part of how they lie to you.

271,GrumpyPanda13,"I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent and generalized anxiety. 

I have been on meds since 2013 when I got diagnosed. 

I had to try a few different ones because they didn't mesh well (for example I felt more paranoid about crossing the street and getting hit by a car even though I was safely on the crosswalk a good few steps away from the road, or looking out a window in my apartment 18th floor and feeling like I would somehow fall through it.)

The med that I have found works best for me is called effexor. It's a depression-anxiety combo and my doctor started me on 150mg. I have been on this for about 7 years without issue. 
I do still have my eeyore days (depressive episdoes) that last a few days, but I feel like a human and more functional with them. 
The biggest side effect I experience from effexor is if I miss a dose, the day after I feel super dizzy and nauseous and almost hungover or zombie like. But considering the meds helps keep balance in your brain it's not surprising. 

When it comes to meds, you may have to try a few to find what works best for you. You may also have to increase your dose or totally change your meds as you age and circumstances change. Talk with your doc and  touch base with your disability support services at your school (I'm assuming college or university) because not only do many of the college's offer counselling services they also provide other accommodations and can even look at adjusting your course load to help you succeed.

Hope this helps!! Good luck and feel free to touch base if you need to chat with an internet Stranger who has been there.",1,2020-03-02

280,Ilac21,"I don't think people should have to justify why they are depressed, it's an illness that can effect everyone differently. Therapy and medication can be used to manage depression and help to decrease severity of the symptoms. Therapy can help determine what kind of triggers are causing the depression, and it can also help to rewire the brain to have a different reaction to those triggers. It's an illness, and rather than treating it and getting better it sounds like he is just staying ill. You can't force him to get help but I would encourage him to try at least once.

293,Ilac21,"I know that depending on medication is not ideal, it’s not the route I initially wanted to go but after meeting with my doctor and therapist I got a little more insight.

The way the doctor explained it to me was that therapy will absolutely help, but it can only come at the issues from one direction, whereas combining medication with therapy can address the problem from the both directions.

Another thing that the doctor told me was that I won’t necessarily require medication forever, he recommended at least 6 months to 1 year and then decide what I want to do. If I don’t feel comfortable coming off of them then I don’t have to, but if I want to at that time lower my dose until I can wean off then I have that choice. My doctor did not pressure me into medication, it was 100% my choice.

One thing you can't do is just expect you can just snap back into place. It's not your fault you're feeling like this. You need actual help and you need to reach out to people to get better.

I spend all of class waiting to get home, not because I enjoy being home, but because   it helps me get through it.

I can't count the amount of times I have cried my heart out just because I have been so sick of not feeling anything. The only thing that helps momentarily helps is sleeping, but that's only a temporary solution. 

Weekends and holidays (i.e. this Easter weekend) are the worst because I can't force myself to get up and end up crying or sleeping the entire time. I also feel super guilty because I should be able to feel something, especially during ""happy times"" such as the weekend and holidays. Just gotta hang on, at least that's what I say to myself.

Everyone I know is happy and has good relationships meanwhile I can go weeks without someone texting me first. Even then its usually because they need something.

It sucks really bad. 

Even though all of our depressions express themselves differently, we're all struggling with the same thing.

I now have five panic attacks a day, I can't get up, I can't escape my own thoughts etc.

My family also 'say' they want me to get better, yet when I'm asking them for help, they either ignore me, imply that I'm not worth the treatment, or explain why they think I'm exaggerating. I always feel super guilty that I need to ask for help. I feel like I should be able to handle myself and I shouldn't be putting pressure on people to help.

Even though I know that there are people out there who feel the same way, it always feels like nobody immediately around me is feeling the same way.

Hopefully, she just didn't have enough time to reply, and she'll get back to you soon!

Either way, don't let what happened affect you any further. If it didn't work, then that just means that you have the opportunity to find someone who really cares about you. It shows a lot of character that you've been able to make yourself vulnerable. Things will always get better :)",1,2019-05-06

I've also felt completely alone this entire process. There's nobody to comfort me when I'm down, nobody to force my head up. Nada. 

I get how tough that must be. To have someone/something that helped you and then have it taken away. But, you have to find a way to complete yourself. Shit happens in life. It's important that you're able to recover and move forward, no matter how impossible that may seem.",1,2019-05-06

Honestly, you need to learn how to trust yourself. You need to learn how to be your own rock. By asking what you can do to save yourself, it sounds like you don't want to die. You just want to stop suffering so much. I totally get that. 

I'm 16 too. I find it hard to find a reason to keep moving because I'm still stuck on what my future is going to look like. I can barely get through the day, so how can I think about the next year?

Personally, I find being numb worse than being sad. At least when I'm sad, I know that I'm human. I know that sounds a little redundant, but it's hard to feel human when you're such an empty shell.",20,2019-05-06

I absolutely hate how I'm unable to form basic social connections that everyone else is able to form. 

I doubt that loneliness alone is the root cause of your panic attacks, I totally could be wrong, but it totally sounds like it's causing you so much grief. You mention that the 'bad shit is almost over'. Maybe that means that you have to build yourself back up before you can get to have the fun you want? Its not like getting better happens over time. I know this mental illness has definitely broken me down, so maybe you need time to be happy with yourself before you place so much of your value as a human being on what other people think about you.

Just because it's been a few days, that doesn't mean that there's no hope. I'll tell you a little story about my experience with being ghosted:

So this summer, at a camp/summer course, I met this guy and we really connected. People would constantly tell us that we would be cute as a couple and we were practically the same human being. For two weeks, it was nice to have that type of connection. After the camp ended, we parted ways. He was the only person at the camp who lived in a completely separate country. We exchanged Instagrams to keep in contact. I reached out to him, but it took around two weeks for us to have one conversation. After that one conversation, he just disappeared. I was really heartbroken because I wished that it could have somehow worked out - despite him living around 9 hours away (by plane) and in another country. After some time, I got over him. 

Fast forward to a week ago, I get this text. I kid you not, this was the exact text: ""Ok im back"". This was NINE MONTHS after he completely disappeared seemingly off the face of the Earth. We had a few conversations since then, and he hasn't responded to me and it's been about a week. I'm not into him like I used to be, but it was nice to have a few conversations here and there.

Never lose hope. Even if she never replies to you, I know you'll find someone who will fill that role in your life!",2,2019-05-07

You just need to find the right people. It's easy to tell yourself things like this, even i do sometimes, but it's only your depression speaking for you, and you shouldn't be just a puppet. Another thing is, you need to really talk to people and reach out, explain to them what's going on with you, i'd imagine some would get it. ",1,2019-03-06
441,Mordcrest,"Let me tell you something, i don't believe this is an uncommon feeling in those with depression. I know I myself feel much the same. Sure, i have great friends and family that are supportive, but yet i still don't feel compelled to ""live for them"" because it's just not enough. I keep going on though, for multiple reasons. Something to keep in mind though, maybe you haven't found someone who you want to live for yet, or maybe it's not a ""who"" at all, it's a ""what"". maybe one day you'll find something or someone you think is worth living your life for, something good enough to be worth it. Maybe it's a career, or a place, or a lover, or a friend, but perhaps you just haven't found it yet. Humans go through life always looking for something, with or without depression. Always in search of whatever might be important to us. Maybe people with depression just have to search harder.

443,Mordcrest,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is not as common as regular depression and it also sucks because it's the worst form of it. Where others go up and down you just feel horrible every day. I know because that's what i have as well. This may not be reassuring, but it's not going to be easy. Regardless of the difficulty, i've made it this far and survived through some really shitty times and if i can do it, you can too. It does help to know you're not the only one suffering through something, even though it sucks to know other people suffer the same fate it's ok to find comfort in having others that can relate to you. The best part of our situation, is we still have enough willpower left to fight back against it and realize we DON'T want to die, and make no mistake, that is a very good thing. We may not know why we want to live, but it's good enough just to know we do. It means the depression isn't winning, and that means there is hope for our future. This tug of war you're experiencing, i feel it too. Every day is a battle, every year a war, but if you're still alive the next morning, that's another battle you've won. So until we do find what we really want in life, it might not be so bad to just realize simply surviving is an accomplishment. I hope my words can offer some comfort. ",1,2019-03-15

447,Mordcrest,"This...probably isn't going to help, but i have a similar problem, except i have too many people to reach out to. Too many of my loved ones are supportive but i have become more and more wary of reaching out because i'm tired of burdening them with my feelings. There's nothing they can do to help me, no way they can take the pain i feel away. I do have a select few that i can be completely open with, and it does help a little bit i guess, but the thing is, when you are suffering and depressed, unfortunately no one can take that feeling away. As horrible as it sounds, even if you did have people to reach out to you may very well refuse to do so at some point and furthermore, realize it doesn't even help.   


Here's my attempt to help though, if you feel like you have no one to support you, no one to talk to, then it's your responsibility to find good people and become friends with them. build relationships, grow that emotional intimacy so that one day you \*do\* have people you can reach out to. I don't have a huge support net because i sat alone in my room all day being depressed, i went out i talked to people, i made friends, i showed them they could trust me, and that i would always be there for them and they returned the sentiment. Not everyone you meet is worth that kind of investment, and if you feel they aren't, cut them off. Find people that will support you. This is me trying to motivate you, because people who love and support you aren't going to just fall into your lap, and just because you don't have them now doesn't mean you never will. Make that active effort to build those supports. No matter what you may think ,you have it in you to do that, you just need to try.",1,2019-06-13
448,Mordcrest,"There's really no way to ""get over"" it, it's the depression attacking your mind at an inopportune time. The best thing you can do, and what i do, is just resist it.

449,Mordcrest,That's a true bro right there. We men have to start realizing it's ok for us to be more open with our feelings and relying on each other for support. I'm glad you got the support you needed when you needed it and i hope things continue to improve for you my man.,1,2019-06-16

Yet every day i get up, shave, take a shower, do my hair and get ready. every day i force myself to get out in the world and do \*something\* and it's hard. It's really hard, but i know if i don't do that, i'm going to feel even shittier. Depression is so hard to deal with, but the best thing you can do is fight and resist it. Maybe we'll never be happy, who knows, but life isn't all about happiness. Look for things to accomplish, things to satisfy yourself. Go out and do something you can be proud of, no matter how minor. even if you live your whole life miserable it's still a life worth living because if you can accomplish something, you can be proud of it. I've felt what you feel, i've thought what you've thought, so please believe me when i say you \*can\* get through it all. Look for good friends who will support you and look for hobbies that can distract and satisfy you, even if only a little.

I live in New England and i've literally never once i'm my life met anyone who genuinely hated homosexuals, or if i did, i never learned about it.

455,Mordcrest,"It's extremely common to think this way and it's super easy to let it get to you, but seriously, don't worry about it. Everyone goes at their own pace in life, if you feel like yours is too slow then speed up, same thing if it's going too fast, slow down. I'm 24 and i've never had a job, girlfriend, and i'll prolly never graduate college with how slow i'm going but i don't let it bother me because i have a slower pace than most. It's a good pace, i don't get stressed out much and i still make sure i'm working towards being able to live independently one day. The problem with life is we're so encouraged to GO GO GO, and speed through everything as fast as possible and make something of ourselves as soon as we can and it'll burn you out and stress you the fuck out and when you look back on your life, even if you were successful, can you really say you enjoyed it? if you get a career in say, accounting, and work at an office for 40 years and retire, and you had a good job and a nice apartment or even a house and by society's standards you were ""Successful"" but you always worked, you never had time to yourself, you spent your entire life toiling away trying to live up to society's version of success, is that worth it to you? Maybe you think differently, but i'm of the mind that i should enjoy my life and i shouldn't kill myself trying to get a successful career as soon as possible. You need to decide what it is you want from life, then work towards that at whatever pace you feel comfortable with. You aren't a loser until you stop trying, you don't have to resign to it like it was a predetermined fate. I've given up hope that i'll even truly be happy but that doesn't stop me from working towards my goals. You just need to believe in yourself and most importantly, apply yourself. Life is never going to be easy, but the only way you're really going to lose is if you give up, so don't.",1,2019-06-28
456,Mordcrest,"Think about how much of a waste it is for you to do nothing, of course you'll never be successful if you never try and of course you'll never fail if you never try but failure is a part of life, you can't give up each time you fail. You'll fail countless times in life but when you do succeed you'll move forward and you can achieve great things. You may believe you can't accomplish anything but you'll never know that unless you put all your effort into it. You may not care about yourself or your life, but that doesn't mean your life is meaningless. Think of all the things you could do that could bring happiness, or at least satisfaction. Don't just throw that all away for nothing. What if you could've become a successful person with lots of people that support you but since you never tried you don't reach that point? Even if you do fail now what do you realistically have to lose? some time? some energy? it sounds like you don't care much for either so why worry about wasting it? Why even worry about failing if you care not for your life or yourself? the only way you can really go is up from here and if you put in the effort and work to progress, you will get to where you want to be. There may be setbacks, and there may be times you feel better or worse, but when you finally reach your goal you can look back and be satisfied that you reached that point with your own effort, that's worth something i believe.",1,2019-06-29

462,Mordcrest,"First off, I just wanted to thank you for the positivity and support you provided. I really appreciate you taking the time to write this and lend your support to me. 

Secondly, I have to say, I do love myself, I didn't always, but over the last few years I have come to do so. Very recently I feel very deeply in love with a girl who did not love me back, and that hurt more than I can explain in words, but she is very kind and she taught me to love myself and helped me through that pain (one of the reasons why I love her so much). The thing is....I do focus on myself, and I do enjoy my life for the most part. I have a fantastic support net and lots of great friends...but being surrounded by people in relationships (and believe me I am happy for them) hurts a lot from where I'm standing. It's hard for me to see all these good qualities in myself, and for everyone around me to compliment me on my good qualities, and yet still fail to get a girlfriend. That girl I fell in love with drilled it into my head that there's nothing wrong with me, because that's what I've always thought. Now I know there's nothing wrong with me, and I think I'm actually just incompetent or unlucky when it comes to girls. It's not so much that I feel I'll never be happy at all unless I find love, it's more that I feel this sharp pain of loneliness and depression because I have to live without one and I want that to go away.  Truth be told, I'm a hopeless romantic. I've spent lots of time fantasizing about love and I even write a lot of fiction about it. The good and the bad. I've spent my entire life on a journey to improve myself, to become the best version of me, and if I'm being honest I've done pretty damn well. I still have progress to make but I'd say i'm in a great place right now. Still, I can't help the pain I feel in my heart. I want someone to give all my love to, someone I can just pour it all into and see them light up because of it. I think that's part of my problem. I have too much love to give, it can be overwhelming. I've tried to temper it, but even when I thought I did, it was still too much. It might be for the best if I try to shift my focus to other things, like my writing, but that just leaves the wound of loneliness to fester unfortunately. It's a difficult situation I'm in. I'm very particular about the girls I like, because I want something meaningful, and yet I feel so lonely that I wish I could just jump into a relationship, even though I never could, that's just not the type of guy I am. I suppose there isn't really a solution to my problem, and if there is it is well hidden.

Please don't kill yourself though. When i was suicidal recently this girl told me it's stupid to kill myself. Anything i could've ever been ,or ever accomplished is reduced to nothing if i die. She was right. Maybe it feels shitty now, but you'll never know how good your life could be or what you can accomplish if you die now and if you don't keep trying. The best advice i can give is find some purpose in your life, something to live for, something to work towards, some kind of accomplishment. Something you can fight for.

Want some tips? Common interest is the easiest. In fact, just pointing out a stranger wearing a t shirt with something you like on it can start a friendship.

Start with hygiene, make sure you brush your teeth every night, make sure you get up in the morning, try to aim for the same time every day, try to go to bed at the same time every day. Don't stop, don't skip a day, do it every single day, then add more things on. Shower daily, shave daily, do some minor exercises like push ups or sit ups, set up a routine that you don't let yourself break. start setting up times to hang out with your friends occasionally. just go step by step and don't stop. don't let yourself skip even one of the routines, and eventually it'll all become easier.

483,Mordcrest,"\*Exactly\* you're proving Cedow's point here. The fact of the matter is you yourself are admitting there's a stark difference in how people treat you when you are depressed/not depressed, which is credible evidence that your depression is making you \*think\* they're treating you like shit, when in reality, you're just interpreting it that way. See, the nasty thing about depression is, it will hyperfocus, and interpret everything they do with a negative connotation to make you feel worse than you already do. this is something that has been observed by psychologists many times. You're depression, your mental illness is convincing you people are treating you badly when in reality it's lying to you. the first step in combating this is recognizing what's happening. then you need to reject those thoughts, because they are poison and they are lies. Trust me, i used to have the same thoughts when i got depressed, i think a lot of us have, but i learned to fight them.",1,2019-07-27
484,Mordcrest,"You have a fair argument, however, i am not an optimistic person. I'm a pragmatist. My view isn't skewed by optimisim. I've spent years thinking and anylyzing the world and the fact of the matter is the majority of people are good. We just aren't as attuned to it as we could be because of media. You don't hear news stories about everytime something didn't go wrong, only when it did, which means it's too easy to believe the world sucks when in reality it's a false perceptionof evil. This also applies to our every day interactions. You, by nature, aren't going to notice every single time someone is being nice or good to you, because that's what's expected, you are, however, going to notice every single time someone is rude or cruel. That's just how our brains work. You aren't noticing all the bad things that *aren't* happening to you every day. It's an unfortunate fact of life that it's far too easy to see the world as cruel just because you only notice when bad things happen. This is something that have been studied and observed by other philosophers as well. The best thing you can do is try to appreciate what is happening that isn't upsetting to you.",1,2019-07-27
485,Mordcrest,"First of all, i'm not gaslighting you, not sure you know what the term means....anyway it doesn't matter anyway. secondly You're just claiming everyone is shit even though 99% of the people i meet are good people, so clearly there's a divide there in experience. I'm not saying your experience didn't happen, what i am saying is that it could be skewed by pessimism and not be as bad as it seems, the brain is a powerful tool and if you convince yourself everything is shit, then everything *will* be shit. However, from your response part of me doubts you're actually going to listen to me. So if you don't want to take anything i say with any grain of salt feel free, but if you do that i'd rather you just tell me so, that way i don't have to try to convince someone who won't listen to me.",1,2019-07-27
486,Mordcrest,"Bro, i fantasize literally every night that i have a girl to cuddle with and i also have a Sylveon Plushie i sleep with, legit nothing wrong with any of it and you shouldn't worry about it. If it helps you feel better it's all good.",1,2019-09-19

I only have to endure this agony for another 11 years....",2,2019-12-05
515,Mordcrest,"Honestly wish i could say the same. As horrible and ungrateful as it sounds i wish i didn't have so many people that cared about me, they hold me back from ending my life. I want to put an end to my suffering but i'm afraid of hurting them.",1,2019-12-05
516,Mordcrest,"It does, but i also wish you didn't have to know what this feels like. I hope i can change too but i don't believe i will. After 16 years of feeling this way i don't see how it'll suddenly change, everything i do revolves around it, it's honestly kind of like an obssession lol, but yeah thank you for your input it definitely makes me feel a bit better and i'm glad you're doing well",1,2019-12-07

519,Mordcrest,"Not all guys are like that bro, you see, those are what we call ""douchebags"" anyone who hurts you after you've told them that's not ok isn't your friend. My friends would never do that kinda shit to me. they respect me and even if they tease me a bit (i don't mind tbh) i know they accept me. Those guys would live and die for me and I for them, that's true friendship right there. you just need to make true friends my guy. No one who is really your friend is going to judge you for your hobbies.   


In my opinion, it sounds less like you don't want to be a man and more like you just want to be able to act more, well, feminine. My friends and i talk about our feeling and hug each other and shit, we're all manly straight dudes but we're ok with being open with each other.

522,Mordcrest,"Who or what do you have to be ""good enough"" for? sounds like the depression feeding you bullshit. you don't owe anything to anyone",1,2019-12-11
523,Mordcrest,"I appreciate any good natured feedback of course! The problem isn't that i don't have intimate human connections, i have plenty of friends that i consider family, pseudo brothers and sisters that i know would go to great lengths for me, hell some of them i know would even die for me, and I for them, but what i'm missing in my life is a romantic connection. that lovey-dovey affection you can only experience in a relationship. Believe me, i wish so badly that i could change the way my brain works to not need this in my life, but i've tried for 9 years to alter this line of thinking and the more i try to break away fro it, the more depressed i get. in fact a week ago i gave up on the idea entirely and felt genuinely suicidal for the first time in my life. my therapist even has gotten to he point where she doesn't tell me to give up on the idea she tells me to keep trying to find a girl i like. If i could just flip a switch and not want a girlfriend anymore i would, but i think a lot of my personality would disappear with it, i'm a hopeless romantic so that desire is heavily ingrained in who i am as a person. I would love to be spared the constant agony i'm in being alone, believe me, but i don't believe it's ever possible for me to change this part of me. It would be like asking a professional athlete to quit playing sports you know? Anyway i do really appreciate your feedback and sentiments, thank you",1,2019-12-14

527,Mordcrest,"I'm not going to tell you not to do it, or that it's not the answer. I'm going to tell you very plain and simply: This is something you cannot EVER take back, so look inside yourself, search your soul, and make sure this is truly, absolutely what you want and that there are no other options left at all. If you can do that, it's all i ask. I don't have the power to stop you, but i hope you can at least not make the mistake of being too hasty.",1,2019-12-26
528,Mordcrest,"The problem is i don't feel alone, i don't feel a lack of purpose. I have my writing, which is why i'm still alive currently, and i have a lot of people that love me and don't want me to die. Yet i still suffer this agony in my soul. I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before I'm consumed by it and i end my life.",1,2019-12-26

530,Mordcrest,"It is truly unfortunate, this is just the way things are for some of us. People want to believe we can save everyone with enough love and support and drugs but some of us, the rare few, are simply beyond saving. I wish it weren't true but it is.",1,2019-12-26
531,Mordcrest,"it's understandable that you don't know why you're depressed, but i highly advise some inflection and soul searching. it helped me understand a lot about myself and why i feel so shit all the time, perhaps it can help you.",1,2019-12-26

544,Mordcrest,"Oh believe me, i know i'm smart. Not trying to sound full of myself but i am actually a genius. I think my high IQ is actually one of the reasons i'm so depressed. I want someone to help me but 90% of the feedback is things i already thought of. I currently do have meaning in my life i just don't know if it's enough to want to live for. I'm very passionate about writing and i won't allow myself death until i have finished all my works, which'll take several years. Maybe things will be different in a few years, maybe my writing will be fulfilling enough. However, I've always though that in addition to what i have now, i needed that missing piece to feel like it was worth living, i needed to fall in love. So far i'm pathetic in the romance department though and it legit feels impossible to me. It's stupid to be so hung up on getting a girl when i have so many great things going for me but it simply is what it is.   


I am curious though, what meaning did you find exactly?",1,2020-01-10

579,Mordcrest,"First off I want to tell you that you are a really fantastic husband and are doing things a lot of others don't but should, educating yourself on her condition and really listening to what she's going through. I'm sure that helps her immensely and makes things much easier. Keep being as supportive as possible and always ready to listen to her when she needs to talk, this is going to greatly improve her life. 

Next, as someone who has suffered from depression and a plethora of other health issues, I hop you'll pass on a message to her for me.

""I truly do understand what you feel, and how hard, and on the worst days, impossible, it seems to keep going, especially when you have physical health problems on top of it. I sought treatment after treatment for years and a lot of days I felt like absolute shit and didn't see the point in living or trying anymore. I spent years treating something and when I was finally done, another disease popped up and I had to start another rigorous treatment regiment. So on top of all the emotional agony I suffered every day, it seemed like I had a never ending series of physical health problems. I found that, I was at least making some progress though and things were getting easier as I was getting better. Something that helped me immensely was that my friends and family were very supportive and it made the suffering much easier to deal with. It sounds to me like you have a very supportive and loving husband, and I know that the depression makes you feel isolated and alone but you aren't, and when things get bad, do not hesitate to seek support from him. I don't know about your family, but they could be very supportive and make it easier to deal with. It feels like there may be no point in going on because the suffering will never end and you feel like it'll only get worse but you CAN do things that make it more bearable and help yourself get through it all the way to old age. And as someone who hated the idea of having to go to therapy and take meds every day, it truly does help, and by no insignificant amount either. I implore you to seek psychiatric help and get both some anti depressants that work for you and a therapist you like, they WILL make things easier. Nothing will be immediate, but if you work towards it and lean on your loved ones when you need to, I'm certain things will get better. Not all the way better, but enough.""",1,2020-10-08

584,Mtaskofa,"I guess I'm having a slightly similar experience to you; I'm in the first year of my uni course and so far I've been doing fine academically, but my mental health (which was already bad) has definitely deteriorated.

The problems you mentioned are difficult ones to deal with, but to me they don't seem like they would be solved by dropping the course. I really think you should try and complete the course first, even if it feels like your final project is going badly. If you stick at it just a bit longer you finish the course, and no matter how good or how bad you do, it means you have something to show for it 

  Aside from that project, how have you been doing academically? And when you're done with that project is it all finished?

You were bullied for years. Then you were introverted and struggled socially. And despite that, you managed to make friends at home, and then move abroad and do it again. In the end, ok, it didn't last. But not everything does. 

Because of the way those relationships have changed you've forgotten how well you did to make those friends in the first place. It isn't easy. I think that if you moved to another brand new place, filled with strangers, you could replicate it, and make friends again. So why not look from a different perspective. Try to treat the relationships you have now as you would in that scenario in a brand new place. If not, why not try to find new people where you are now. Maybe people you have nothing in common with. And just give it a try. 


To be honest I'm no expert. But writing this helped me think more clearly about my situation and I hope it leads you to consider your situation in a different way too.

I don't have anyone to talk about it to either. I only stayed in contact with one person from my school. And I used to have loads of friends. But you said you're drifting away from your friend group. That means that, at least for the moment, you are still a part of that group, however peripheral",1,2019-03-31

 But I'm a big fan of the shins, mainly their last two albums. A lot of the songs at least feel to me about depression and mental illness, but they're mostly positive about it. For example, the song It's Only Life from Port of Morrow

 ""It's only life, it's only natural
We all spend a little while going down the rabbit hole
The things they taught you, they're lining up to haunt you.
You got your back against the wall
Call you on the telephone, won't you pick up the receiver?

I've been down the very road you're walking now
It doesn't have to be so dark and lonesome
It takes a while, but we can figure this thing out

&gt; The shame of telling my parents... I was so scared that if I didn't get it back I would have no choice but to kill myself. 

This is the very worst thing about me, a because I always think like this.

(Sorry for all this text, I didn't mean it to be so long. You don't have to read it I'm just venting)

 A while back I went to a cinema for a special screening of a documentary. It was only being showed in one particular cinema - in an area of the city I'd never been to - and I hadn't been to a cinema in years, never by myself, because of anxiety. 

I was already anxious enough about it. When I got there I waited about 10 minutes to go in because I was panicking.  When I actually spoke to someone behind the till they told me it was in a different cinema. And that was the worst I have ever felt, because I didn't know where the other cinema was, and the screening was going to start soon.

My parents knew I was going and made it into a huge deal (I hadn't told them about my anxiety yet). So I couldn't go home without seeing it. So my only option was to kill myself. (How, FFS, doesn't my brain realise the flaw in that logic?). 

I was crying so so hard in the middle of a busy shopping centre. It's genuinely the worst I've ever felt in my whole life. 

And in the end? It was all ok. I got to the other cinema on time and enjoyed the film. And didn't tell anyone about my full-blown suicidal panic attack in a packed shopping centre that I'd never seen before. 

Made me realise that things probably aren't that bad. Even though I'll still panic about them.",3,2019-04-10

I've seen people going through a serious transformation when a lot of people were attracted to them. Actual experience does change you.

Self-love is a crutch for empty shells who cannot offer anything to the world except their narcissism.

Maybe the therapist you were seeing wasn't right for you. If you're at the point where you're tired of living the way you are and you don't know what to do, I'd suggest talking to your doctor about antidepressants and find the one that works for you. Best of luck!",1,2019-01-06
806,Roadmapsforthesoul,"Yeah I've been reading about that as well. I may do that. Other people with the same issue have said this is just a symptom of depression and you just have to battle through it, which is likely as well.",1,2019-01-08

808,Roadmapsforthesoul,I started on Trintellix before switching to Lexapro due to my insurance not covering Trintellix. I fortunately never experienced the nausea but it is definitely a common side effect. How long have you been on it? Antidepressants generally take 4-6 weeks to effect your mood.,1,2019-03-04
809,Roadmapsforthesoul,We sort of joke about it too because she's on meds for bipolar disorder so she can't orgasm either. I am fortunate that the relationship isn't just about sex and there's a mutual understanding that sexual issues doesn't mean we don't love each other. Thanks for getting back to me!,2,2019-04-09
810,Roadmapsforthesoul,"Yeah I'm working on it. I'm on Lexapro as well, and I think I'm feeling more angry at them than depressed these days.",2,2019-05-28
811,Roadmapsforthesoul,"This is a completely normal feeling. I suffered from this for a very long time before I got on Lexapro. A lot of this can be traced back to a significant event either from childhood or maybe a relationship of some kind. 

I grew up with a functioning depressed Father, meaning that his moods were inconsistent. The highs could become lows at sny moment. Through therapy I was able to realize that that's where my feeling of dread came from. It usually came on when I was having a good time. All of s sudden my heart would drop into my stomach. What is yours like?",3,2019-05-29
812,Roadmapsforthesoul,"I recently started a new relationship. I'm 29 and spent most of my life never having a serious relrelationship due to depression and anxiety. I literally didn't feel standard emotions like love or attraction for a long time, and any semi-romantic interaction I'd have, in the back of my mind I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. I think lexapro and therapy has done wonders for me. I want to spend time with my girlfriend and actually do things. I don't crave alone time as much, and it makes for a healthier relationship. So it's possible, but seeking help is the first step for sure.",1,2019-05-29
813,Roadmapsforthesoul,"Yeah I hear that. I always see it as my parents talking on a different wavelength. My Dad plays devil's advocate about everything so venting only makes me feel worse. My Mom repeats things she wants me to do, and will literally not respond and look at her phone while I'm talking sometimes. No one is perfect but refusing to change is just not right.",2,2019-05-29
814,Roadmapsforthesoul,"My therapist refers to this as pervasive sadness. Just this underlying sadness that's always there. Things have been better since I've been on Lexapro, but for me it was always me laughing or having fun and then my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach. Depression is always there to remind you, ""This good feeling won't last. Don't have too much fun"".",2,2019-06-03
815,Roadmapsforthesoul,"Pervasive sadness is what my therapist calls it. For me it was pretty much like you described. I'd be laughing or having fun, and then I'd have this sudden feeling of dread and my heart would drop into my stomach.",3,2019-06-03

818,Wendy_Clear,I don’t obsess over being single. I don’t think it’s fair to say “it’s not that bad” when I’m as lonely as I have been. I was trying to make a point that I don’t have anyone and haven’t for a long time and probably won’t for the foreseeable future. I’ve only ever had one significant other and the last 2 years of the relationship were awful so it’s been closer to five years since I’ve had closeness with  anyone.,1,2019-03-29
819,Wendy_Clear,I can’t afford to see a counselor (losing my insurance on Nonday and even with insurance it’s over $150 a visit) &amp; I personally think the keto diet is disgusting. I know people lose weight from it but it’s not a long term solution. I do CICO and up until the past couple weeks I’d been seeing great progress with it.,0,2019-03-29
820,Wendy_Clear,Lol what? I don’t carry cash or bills on me. I have something similar to a wallet called a billfold. I keep a pretty tight budget usually. I don’t spend enough on candy money to need to cut it out of my budget.,1,2019-03-29
821,Wendy_Clear,I have a billfold but I keep it in my purse - I don’t carry it on me lol.,1,2019-03-29

826,Wendy_Clear,"I somehow have managed to go no more than a week without hitting the gym since November. The week I missed was due to -60 degree weather a couple months ago. When you said your parents made you look bad in front of your siblings I felt that - I had a difficult adolescence BECAUSE of my depression. I was moody and just wanted to smoke weed and fuck off, which isn’t too different than what I do now but my parents were over the top. I’m a good person and my parents made it seem like I was bad person to them and they were very young so just took it at face value. ",1,2019-03-30

839,Wendy_Clear,"I’ve had two so far with my third coming this Saturday. It’s killing me financially &amp; I wasn’t in a great place there to begin with. The first infusion I noticed I was a little less irritable &amp; less sensitive to lights/noises. My second was on Sunday &amp; I’ve been pretty depressed the last couple of days but it could just be situational from a couple of recent letdowns. The infusions themselves were fine, I feel funny for an hour and then leave. Last time the nurse did say she was going to up my dose a lot next time so I can get into more of a relaxed state. So I’m anticipating that I’ll be feeling pretty fucked up on Saturdays infusion lol.",1,2020-02-05
840,Wendy_Clear,"It’s so hard. I don’t know how I manage to do it most days. Earlier this week the depression was so bad I called in sick 2 days in a row. I think my only motivation to come each day is the fact that no matter what, I need a roof over my head to sulk in.",1,2020-02-07
841,Wendy_Clear,I feel the same way. It’s like I don’t even want to strive for happiness anymore because the fall out is so hard to recover from. I’ll have something nice for just a few moments &amp; then I have to start the uphill climb to “barely functioning” all over again.,2,2020-02-07
842,Wendy_Clear,"Because it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I honestly felt the same way about a month ago. I haven’t felt any emotion beside depression or anger in years. But I recently started ketamine infusions &amp; even though I’m not totally out of the woods yet, I’m noticing huge strides of improvement. I still feel depressed but I keep getting little glimpses/reminders of what life is like without my “dark passenger” &amp; it’s been giving me hope. I hope things turn around for you. They’re expensive but if you have the means, you should really consider ketamine.",1,2020-02-11
843,Wendy_Clear,It’s the depression that is making you hate spending time with people. Just know that your true self wants to be around people but the depression is what’s making socializing a chore. It might take time but you won’t feel this way forever!,1,2020-02-12
844,Wendy_Clear," Absolutely. I think the “fighting” is called CBT in a therapy setting. You essentially reframe the bad thoughts so they don’t have the distortions that depression gives you, and the idea is that if you change your thoughts you change your mood. It’s like training your brain to not just automatically go to the dark place.",1,2020-02-13
845,Wendy_Clear,"If you post things about being depressed, people are going to respond with words of encouragement. What do you want them to do, be like “yeah man your life is gonna suck forever lol”. Not to mention, this sub is for people with depression. Nobody is lying when they say things get better. I have had dysthymia and major depressive disorder for years and tbh had the same attitude as you up until recently when I started ketamine infusions. So speaking from experience, yeah, it can get better. You have to find the inner strength to put in the work, which is easier said than done I know. It took me trying to kill mysef by bashing my face in with a metal bar to get a spark of “oh shit I need help” and reach out to someone. So I hope you find it in you to try to get better.",1,2020-02-14

i'm sure you're not a bad person, although at times i myself feel like i'm bad too.

&gt; A simple, lazy, stupid asshole who deserves to die.

I'm also a lazy asshole, but you don't deserve to die. My laziness in this shithole that is depression is not even trying. I don't know. 

&gt; If I trully hated my life and all i can do is complain, why haven't I just ended my life already? Could it be that I'm just an attention-seeking hog who needs people to drop everything because I can't stop being dramatic? I feel it is so.

SAME. FUCK THIS HIT CLOSE TO HOME.

&gt; I play video games 10+ hours a day. I don't enjoy it much

i haven't even found motivation to play anymore.

you're not a dick, you are a person worthy of life and love and although you may not see it right now, you are struggling, but it'll pass, i promise.

&gt; I see videos and comments and posts on the internet of people (you guys) who have it so much worse. 

i feel like you have it so much worse than i do.

i've been threatened with being hospitalized if i self harm again. It's so difficult.

&gt; I must have faked that to get the diagnosis.

I keep thinking the same thing about myself, but I gotta remind myself that those who diagnosed me (and you too) are professionals who'd never diagnose if they weren't sure.

You do sound depressed, do not think that you're faking it. Have you talked about this to your therapist? Maybe you have already but I'm asking because you seem to be so enclosed in yourself. Do talk about it.

You deserve help aswell. &lt;3

I feel fake because I think *""it can't be THIS easy to get out of depression?? maybe I was never depressed.""* and then the obsessiveness comes and my mind RACES with those thoughts until it really hurts me. Probably tomorrow will be a bad day again, I can't care anymore. It's like I want to be depressed? (this adds to the feeling of faking it!).

I don't know how I'll be tomorrow. What surprises me is how unstable my mood change was. I was on the very limit yesterday, crying and planning to kill myself and today I woke up feeling so much better and was able to genuinely smile and laugh. 

I don't know when I'll be low again.

What I don't like is when people who have **never** experiences this bullshit say ""I'm so depressed"" just because they like, lost their phone and the next day they're fine.

I hope I could snap out of it. I really want to do it but I can't, and people don't understand that.

She doesn't see me as BPD probably because she has so many other disorders that have comorbidity with BPD, plus she's had psychotic episodes and I haven't. She probable attributes that to BPD, when it's not and that why she doesn't trust my diagnosis?? I don't know.

She even blamed my psychiatrist for giving me benzodiazepines.... I know that people with BPD have a higher risk of developing and addiction to benzos but like srsly like he hadn't diagnosed me yet when he prescribed them to me.

&gt; Maybe they are also just trying to shield themselves. Who would want to believe their child / sibling tried to commit suicide?

It's so shitty when depression hits you in the middle of the semester, I don't want the same thing to happen to me when the next semester starts in March. I feel like I'm a little bit better now because I'm in vacations but it'll all come crushing down on me when I'm back in class.",1,2018-01-18

I've seen people who are going through a rough time in their lives, and feeling down is a natural and completely normal reaction but generally people want everything that they feel mentally to be diagnosed as a mental illness and then they say it's depression.

Between these moments I’ve found sparks of happiness, not from people but from the nature around me. I’m not alive only to please the people but to experience the earth around me, the scents of nature, the wind in my hair and the sun on my skin. I was put here to experience, not to live up to others expectations. 

And if you chose to end it and end up getting severely injured and hospitalized. You can’t enjoy these things that you could before. The risk is not worth taking. 

Are you currently on medication? If not I suggest you look into that.

And you will fall right back in the black hole. You may be even more crushed than you were before. I think it’s better to be alone until we are more mentally “stable”. I really like the idea of growing with someone but, at least for me, I’m not ready yet. I think a healthy relationship involves two whole people, not two halves.

1167,dreworbuskeridunno,"First off thank you so much for commenting on this, it means a lot to see that people truly do care and it puts a reminder in place that yes infact humans do want to help each other, even if they are a stranger. And that is a powerful thing. So thank you again

Secondly in terms of how my family support me, they do everything that they can to listen, give advice and generally be a shoulder to cry on if things are getting tough to handle. This applies to my father and my brother but also extended family members as well. And yeah you’re 100% on the money when you say you think they would disagree, if I were to ask them if they think they’d be better off without me they’d jump out their skin with concern. Trouble is as much as family, friends, doctors, therapists etc want to help me I don’t feel like I deserve any of it. But looking at thing from a logical standpoint, there’s no reason why I wouldn’t deserve that. It’s the same help that anyone in this position would be offered, so what’s wrong with me getting it also right?

And another thing, you must be able to read people like a book because making other people happy, no matter if it’s a small or big thing, is one of the few things I feel so fulfilled and happy doing, it gives me this feeling deep down inside that I may just have a purpose. As cliche as it sounds it sort of ‘fuels me’ because if it weren’t for the people in my life that I want to make happy and do things for, then I may never have made it this far. By this point it’s entirely possible I would have taken my own life were it not for others caring about my existence. So I guess the least I can do is keep at that, and to keep trying to make people smile and bring joy and do nice things and be as respectful as I can be.

It sucks because it pulls away that tiny shred of confidence you had in yourself and the courage to see it through. There’s loads of things i’d love to get into, my brain just convinces me that it would all be for nought and that nothing would come of it. Every. Single. Time. Without fail.

But this is not the way I intend to keep thinking, I want to change, I need to change. Constantly selling myself short is no way to live and it is going to take some time and dedication but I will make a considerable effort to start focusing on the positives, the what ifs, the I can do’s and so on.",1,2019-09-02
1173,dreworbuskeridunno,"Sorry i’m not sure what to reply with, I get so nervous about it too like “cmon drew this has to be a good one otherwise you’re gonna make people hate you” it’s stupid",1,2019-09-04
1174,dreworbuskeridunno,"Honestly, in the total three times I have self harmed all I can say I got out of it was physical and emotional pain. It will do the opposite of taking some of the pain away, something that a lot of people think might happen if they try it for the first time (myself included).

It is a million times over seriously not worth it. Not only does it hurt like hell when you go to wash the blood off and when you touch the affected area of your body (or if the cuts make contact with clothing, furniture etc) especially in the first few deals when the wound is fresh, but it hurts to look at. It hurts seeing the damage you caused to yourself deliberately because in a momment of desperation you thought it could bring something along the lines of relief or satifaction or anything that would just give you a temporary high. You’ll feel immense regret when you notice other people looking at it, even more so when they are aware that the cut was self inflicted.

Please do not harm yourself, it wouldn’t feel good to know that someone else made that same mistake as me. And if the urge to do so becomes too much to handle then by all means reach out for help. To your parents, a medical professional, a helpline etc just making that first step to say “I need help” will benefit you in the long run. I hope you are staying safe and that you feel better sooner rather than later",1,2019-09-04
1175,dreworbuskeridunno,"Aww that’s a nice thought, a couple of cats would definitely make me happier, even if only every so often",1,2019-09-04
1176,dreworbuskeridunno,"Oh there’s loads of flaws in that plan, as well as the fact that I have no idea how you’d even go about changing your name. Prolly have to do all sorts of illegal shit. It’s really just wishful thinking more than anything, I don’t think I would be able to go through with it. As much as I don’t understand why, people would miss me and forever have unanswered questions about my dissapearance, really wouldn’t be that different than me taking my own life in that regard. I don’t wanna put them through that so yeah it wont be happening anytime soon.",1,2019-09-04
1177,dreworbuskeridunno,"Yeah if that oppurtunity ever arose, as unlikely as it is i’d take it because i’m not entirely sure i’d be able to handle abandoning people who care, I would refuse to get close to anyone. The most i’d do in terms of social interaction is talking to workers at shops and anything important that needed my immediate attention like a phone conversation with the bank. I’d avoid making friends or trying to find a relationship and just generally keep my distance from people. It would be interesting to see how it played out",1,2019-09-04
1178,dreworbuskeridunno,"Absolutely, infact that term you used ‘back at square one’ is exactly what I call that feeling too. You start to perk up, you’re smiling a bit more, laughing a bit more, more talkative than usual, feel like you can acomplish whatever needs done that day doesn’t have to be anything huge like washing dishes. And then that little inkling of hope you felt is torn away as you start to feel like you did 1 month, 2 months, maybe even a year ago. It fucking hurts and I’m sorry that a lot of you folks out there feel that horrible feeling too. I wish all of you well and that you overcome this, there’s no reason why you wouldn’t deserve to be happy",1,2019-09-14
1179,dreworbuskeridunno,Would you like to talk about it? Might not be the best person to speak to for this but if you just want someone to listen I’ll give it my best shot,1,2019-09-20
1180,dreworbuskeridunno,"That’s so good to hear, best of luck with it!",1,2019-09-21
1181,dreworbuskeridunno,"Happy birthday friend, today is your day and you can do whatever it is you want to do. And your birthday is a good reminder that you’ve made it through another year of your journey, times may get tough but you are still here and that is something to be celebrated. Not saying you have to throw a huge party or anything but just tell yourself you’re doing great okay? Have a good one",1,2019-09-21
1182,dreworbuskeridunno,"Thank you for this, sometimes it’s easy to forget that this emotional embodiment of a huge wall is something you can break through. And when you see someone else share their experience with that same wall, moving through it and getting to the other, brighter happier side it makes you stop and think ‘hey maybe I can do that too’

And sorry for your loss, i’m sure your friend is so proud of you making it this far on this long stretch of road called life, seeing all that you have achieved and have yet to do",1,2019-09-21
1183,dreworbuskeridunno,"You’re absolutely right, everyone here is so supportive and understanding.

This might sound really pathetic but honestly this sub has made me go out of my way to talk to strangers more often. Both on here and out in the real world, i’ve started making eye contact with folks and saying good morning and smiling and it feels so good when you see them smile in response. It feels good to hope that it made their day and that it might make them feel a little better too",2,2019-09-22
1184,dreworbuskeridunno,"Jesus I can’t believe they had people search your room and interrogate you when you were a CHILD! All just because of you making a comeback to another kid who was being a jerk, i’m so sorry that you had to deal with so much crap and am very happy for you that things have steadily gone up, best of luck in your future friend!",1,2019-09-22
1185,dreworbuskeridunno,"Maybe not ‘destined’ per say, but it definitely feels like one of two possible outcomes. The outcomes being either i’m gonna get my life in order and keep living, or i’m going to continue to spiral deeper and deeper the older I get until eventually it becomes unbearable. But i’m aiming for outcome number 1 and I think you can do it too, you deserve to feel happy and not be held down by emotions. Wishing you the best of luck and a great life friend",1,2019-10-03
1186,dreworbuskeridunno,"Would have to disagree with that, anything i’ve written is nothing special. And I feel like i’m probably coming off as a condescending prick who’s trying way too hard to sound sophisticated in these posts and replies. Maybe i’m wrong",1,2019-10-14
1187,dreworbuskeridunno,"Nah it’s part of England I think. Either that or maybe part of Scotland. Geography is tough

Edit: I should specify I mean it has the same name, but it’s somewhere in the Uk",2,2019-10-14
1188,dreworbuskeridunno,"That’s funny. The phrase “Don’t worry.” It would be great if I had that luxury but that’s just not how my idiot brain functions. It worries about things constantly, even things that no normal individual would stop to consider. The smallest thing like for example worrying if I gave someone a dirty look without realsing as I walked past them. Do things like that really matter in the grand scheme of things? Probably not but that won’t stop me from panicking over it.

And to be honest, that is a great question to ask because I don’t even know what I enjoy. I’m that much of a lifeless waste of skin and bone that I’ve never really had anything that could be conceived as a hobby. I play games on the console every now and then but it’s more so to pass the time and talk to friends I know in person. I suppose I did enjoy writing, in school. And I’ve always hoped that one day I could become a half decent writer and publish books. But the harsh reality of it is that this will never happen. Everything I write is shit. It’s repetitive, drawn out, boring dribble. Teachers and a few people in the class would have very nice things to say about stuff i’d write but they were probably just trying to make me feel good because they’re aware my self confidence is non-existant.

And in terms of me being a horrible person, I think the fact that I rarely even say hi to dad most nights he comes home speaks volumes of just how deplorable I am, as a son as well as a human being.",1,2019-10-14
1189,dreworbuskeridunno,"I think i’m worthless because I have no purpose to serve. There’s nothing i’m really ‘good at.’ I think i’m worthless because i’m a horrible person, I don’t understand why anyone would think differently.

And as much as I hate doing it, I do occasionally force myself to get out of my room and sit in the living room to speak to either my dad or brother. I do sometimes walk outside for a couple of minutes too. At this point though, I think death is really the only viable option for me, i’m not made to live like a normal adult. It’s not something I can hope to achieve",1,2019-10-14
1190,dreworbuskeridunno,That’s probably what he would say. But i’m nothing.,1,2019-10-14
1191,dreworbuskeridunno,Mcr are great! There’s so much energy and emotion in a lot of their songs that more often than not can actually put a smile on my face and get me pumped up. It doesn’t last forever but it sure does feel nice,1,2019-10-15
1192,dreworbuskeridunno,"It’s hard for me to see it any other way than that. I’m sorry, it’s probably annoying trying to get that message through to me",1,2019-10-15
1193,dreworbuskeridunno,It’s hard for me to see it any other way. The truth could stare me straight in the face but my stubborn ass won’t accept it,1,2019-10-15
1194,dreworbuskeridunno,"Life would be a lot more dull without it that’s for sure, what about you friend? What music do you enjoy?",1,2019-10-15
1195,dreworbuskeridunno,"It’s a bit all over the place, I know about a maximum of 3, rarely 4, songs per musician or band. Pretty much any genre really, although I do enjoy a lot of songs from the 80’s to 90’s as I was influenced by both of my parents. In the main playlist I made on spotify like 6 years ago it’s a big jumbled up mess of pop, rock, hip hop, a tiny bit of jazz cause for some reason I wanted that in there, some classical pieces and who knows what else. Right now though I was just picking and choosing a few at random, a song by coldplay followed by a song by the 1975, then it was guns and roses. Dunno what i’ll put on next but anything is better than silence.",1,2019-10-15
1196,dreworbuskeridunno,"You mean just before taking my own life? If so then I could see myself leaving a note somewhere in my room where I know it’ll be found. It would just say “Goodbye everyone, i’m sorry that I couldn’t stay strong enough for you all.” Notice how I say ‘for you all’ because I don’t think i’m staying alive for my own sake. Isn’t that pathetic?",1,2019-10-15
1197,dreworbuskeridunno,"Music does help in its own mysterious way, I find myself closing my eyes and being brought to tears most of the time. For whatever reason it kinda soothes me, I guess crying would be a good way to release all these negative feelings even if it’s only temporary. It sucks because family members and friends of mine have shown me a never ending amount of support and tell me every chance they get that they’re available anytime. I can’t do it though, I can’t bring this crap up because I feel like i’m just burdening them, annoying them, making them feel uncomfortable and worry to an unnecessary level about me. And that feels so self centred, to have someone think about you and care. It feels wrong but it shouldn’t. I should show my appreciation for how much everyone cares but all I can think is that they’d be better off without me in their lives. It’s childish in reality.",1,2019-10-15
1198,dreworbuskeridunno,Yeah I’m having strong urges to take my own life and i’ve been sitting here in my room obsessing over it for the past few days. I don’t know if I can stop this and if it’s too late for me or not,1,2019-10-15
1199,dreworbuskeridunno,"I’m getting pretty close to acting on suicidal thoughts, this is the first time i’ve ever spent days planning what i’ll do and it worries me",1,2019-10-15
1200,dreworbuskeridunno,"Oh no this definitely is my fault. I dug this hole myself because i’ve always been a cowardly pushover dumbass who never tries hard enough at anything. And i’ve always looked at myself as scum, just a putrid sack of flesh with no common sense, no goals in sight, no particular strengths but plenty of weaknesses. From the day I was born this was a pre-determined path that i’d be going down. Maybe there’s more I could’ve done to avoid it from happening but it’s too late now.",1,2019-10-15
1201,dreworbuskeridunno,"No problem, hopefully this conversation has made you feel at least slightly better than you were before it and you are most definitely deserving of those things, especially since from what you said it sounds as though you like to go out of your way to make others happy, that’s just one of the many reasons people would have to care about you!

And thank you for taking some time to open up about how you’re feeling. That’s not always an easy feat but 10 times out of 10 it can really help you clear your head when you do, speaking from experience, best of luck to you friend :)",1,2019-10-24
1202,dreworbuskeridunno,Goodness gracious! How could we have been so blind?! Those yellow potassium filled bastards are plotting something I just know it /(0•0)\,1,2019-10-24
1203,dreworbuskeridunno,"It’s so horrible that many of us who are dealing with depression feel that exact way you just described, there could be a sea of compliments and praise thrown your way, or all of your family members and friends could throw a party for you, talking about how proud of you and your acomplishments they are and yet it makes no sense to us. We struggle to see why anyone cares about us. We overlook all of our positive traits, strengths and talents and see someone who is not worthy of the respect of another human being.

I would hope you have spoken to someone such as a therapist about what happened with your brother. That certainly couldn’t have been an easy thing to go through at such a young age and the guilt sounds like it’s crushing you, like a giant weight was placed upon your shoulder and you shouldn’t have to feel responsible for that. I also hope that your mother does not hold anything against you or think that it was in any way your fault

I wish I knew the perfect words to say that would make things much more bearable for you, i’m still trying to figure things out myself so i’m no expert. What I can say though is that positive reinforcement from those close to you does tend to break through that internal wall and every so often there will be momments of clarity that you are loved and respected, that you deserve to have people in your life who care about you and that you deserve to be happy. I know it’s difficult to see it this way, but many have felt this way long before we have and if they could power through that and feel like themselves again then there’s no reason you and I cannot both do the same. I believe in you",1,2019-10-24

This is a very interesting situation, and kudos to you for lasting as long as you have, food is a big need for me otherwise i’d be a huge grumpy bear all of the time.

Now you don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to but would you say there’s a reason you think your coworkers don’t take kindly to your prescence? Are they rude to you? Hopefully not because that would be a work enviroment anyone would struggle to cope in",1,2019-10-24
1207,dreworbuskeridunno,"Yes yes yes everytime. I’ll come back home feeling upbeat with a smile on my face for a few minutes and then boom: I start to overthink about all of my actions and words during the time we were spending together. 

‘Was I coming across bitter and hateful in the tone of my voice?’ 

‘Did I sound enthusiastic enough? Or did it seem like I didn’t want to be there and was bored out of my mind?’

‘Did my body language or facial expressions give them the wrong idea and make them think I’m upset with them?’

 ‘Was I only brought along because they’ve known me for as long as they have and feel an obligation to do so, not because they really want me there?’

Things like that, things that aren’t true and i’d have no evidence supporting the possibility of them being true. Logic doesn’t stop us from worrying though does it?",1,2019-10-27
1208,dreworbuskeridunno,"Don’t really know what i’m living for but there’s a chance that one of these days i’ll find it.

1210,dreworbuskeridunno,"This was so well written! Felt like I had picked up a book, and from the sounds of things it seems like you’re pushing through the harsh waters of mental struggle and are almost home free, I hope you find happiness and live a life that you feel in total control of. Sometimes it feels like depression has you in its grasp and that you’re chained to a wall unable to move but it is possible to break out of that chain",1,2019-10-31
1211,dreworbuskeridunno,"I feel that, very envious of those who find enjoyment in just about anything they do in life. You’re spot on with the point that it seems like we’re characters in a game. You aquire points (in this case money) from doing tasks, that you can spend on cosmetics (clothing, makeup, hair dye, tattoos etc), healing items (medicine) and upgrades like a vehicle. And birthdays are like updates to your game, the new features being new things you can legally do because you’re older.

All of that aside, i’m sure that there is something for each of us that will give us reason to want to stay alive, to enjoy waking up everyday. We might not find out what it is tommorow, we might not find out till we’re 80 but i’d like to believe there are things that make it all worthwhile. Whether that be a hobby, a job, having a pet, having a child or something as simple as watching the sun rise in the early morning. I hope that you find that thing friend, you deserve to enjoy your time on this planet like all of the other people we see do. And I hope that it helps to know that someone out there hears you and cares.",1,2019-10-31

It’s just been established that this is life now, you’re born, you go to school and learn a few things that are important and many things that aren’t, you’re told to get good grades, you finish or drop out of school, you then either have the options of college, university or starting early with a job.

1215,dreworbuskeridunno,"It’s so cruel that life just throws these damn handicaps out left right and centre as if just trying to live each day and figure out what you want to do isn’t hard enough. Literally no one asks to be born but they are, they’re thrust into the world and expected to do so many things in a very specific way because if they don’t then they aren’t seen as a normal person. Even when you start to think you’ve finally got a handle on things life just decides to toss more crap at you. If there is a god then whoever they are, they’re a sick sadistic fuck.

And no I am a dumbass, I sit here in my room and whine on reddit about how hard it is to live day by day instead of doing what I should be doing and focusing on killing myself. I don’t deserve sympathy or help. I should be dead.",1,2019-11-10
1216,dreworbuskeridunno,"I’d like to hope that one day we will both see our own potential and be proud of being us. I’m sorry to hear that you are feeling that way, it’s so discouraging trying to go about everyday life when you cannot find worth in yourself. I’m sure there are loads of people who used to feel the way we do and overtime learned to appreciate their strengths and not give themselves a hard time about their weaknesses or mistakes they make.

1217,dreworbuskeridunno,"No worries, hope the suggestion is of use to you and that you’re keeping yourself safe. As confusing and indecipherable as our thoughts can be sometimes, it’s not your fault. Even someone who is not diagnosed with depression will occasionally have thoughts or feelings that they may not fully understand. Humans are complex beings.

And if the idea of writing or sketching what’s on your mind doesn’t sound appealing then i’d suggest talking to someone you know and simply saying “i’m not quite sure how i’m feeling.” Through talking to them you might get down to the bottom of things and i’m sure they’d be glad to know you reached out to them because they care about you. And yes I know that starting that conversation can be very difficult, as the saying goes ‘the first step is always the hardest’ but I know you’ve got the courage to speak about your feelings. After all, you did make this post

All in all I do sincerely hope that things get better for you friend, there are a lot of us stuck in this emotional cave and slowly but surely we’re trying to find our way outside. You matter :)",1,2019-11-22

1219,dreworbuskeridunno,"You could try getting a pen/pencil and paper, closing your eyes and thinking of what words come to mind right now and what words you would say describe your current feelings. Then once you have a few words in mind jot them down and you can show them to someone you trust and want to open up to, or you can keep it for only you to see if that’s preferable.

Better yet, you can close your eyes and just let your hand move around freely on the paper, and visualize your emotions and thoughts as something you can draw (say for example a cloud with bolts of lightning surrounding it. The cloud being you and the lightning being intruding thoughts, fears, doubts and so on)

This may have been suggested to you before but for a lot of people dealing with depression (myself included) it honestly does work wonders from time to time. It can help you better understand yourself sometimes. I hope things are okay and that you continue to fight this. Depression does not back down but that doesn’t mean you cannot overcome it. We believe you can and I hope you do too &lt;3",1,2019-11-22

1232,dreworbuskeridunno,"Really? Huh, that’s honestly a suprise to hear. Wasn’t really sure anyone else had that same thought. I’m sorry to hear that you’ve also felt that way and I commend you for being open about it, it’s not always easy to speak about these kinds of things.",1,2020-01-29
1233,dreworbuskeridunno,"Oh that definitely sounds familiar, having a week or so of good days only to slip back down to feeling the way you did before again. It can be so unpredictable at times right?

And yeah you’re right, it would be stupid to throw in the towel this early. It’s just that I don’t know if i’d manage having this for my whole life. As dumb as it sounds i’m at the point where i’m telling myself ‘wait till you turn 30 and see where you’re at. If you’re still in the same spot it might be time to say goodbye.’ I’m sure anyone who’s had depression for most of their life would want to slap me after reading that, and I wouldn’t blame them.

Regardless of how it goes, thank you for leaving a comment friend",1,2020-01-29
1234,dreworbuskeridunno,"Ah see that’s an issue, I should be confiding in family members or friends but I shy away from that because it makes me, in my eyes, a living breathing burden to them. It’s not the truth and it’s a silly way of thinking but I cannot help the way my brain operates, so talking to people in my life is sort of out of the picture.

That leaves me with bringing it up with a doctor which I plan to, just need to wait till next wednesday for my first appointment. I recently registered to a different medical centre because the previous one and the general practitioner were not very helpful. So next wednesday will be my first appointment with this new gp and i’ll try to be as honest and thorough with them as I can. Just have to hold out until then.

Thank you for leaving a comment friend, it’s appreciated",1,2020-01-29

1236,dreworbuskeridunno,"I don’t think i’m a good person at all. And if you were to ask me why I would freeze and struggle to say anything. Because I have no reason or reasons why. I just seem to think that’s the case. I have this burning hatred for myself that’s been there for as long i’ve been alive.

Thank you for trying to help me but there’s not a chance I am deserving of happiness. I’m sorry. I just don’t think I can see things any other way.",1,2020-02-12
1237,dreworbuskeridunno,"No worries, we’re all in this together and being there for one another is a good way to cope. I hope things look up for you soon :)",1,2020-03-18
1238,dreworbuskeridunno,"Maybe the fact that you’re still alive means great things are awaiting you in your future?

That may not help to hear but just thought a little positive reinforcement could help you look at it differently",1,2020-03-18
1239,dreworbuskeridunno,"Sounds less like stating the obvious and more like being a voice of reason heh, but yes I see where you’re coming from.

And that’s what makes it so frustrating is having clear physical evidence that proves my mind wrong yet it will persist that things are not as they seem. Sometimes I wish we could just open up our heads like the lid of a bin, grab our brain and take it out for a little while so we could just experience some temporary inner peace, ceasing relentless worries, doubts and strong emotions getting to you. You could just lay down and power down for an hour and then plug your brain back in when you feel ready.

Thank you for speaking to me, it was brief sure but it does feel better to unravel things on one’s mind. (ugh did I really just use one to refer to myself? Disgusting)",2,2020-03-18
1240,dreworbuskeridunno,Most likely yeah. And I shouldn’t try to convince myself that i’m not allowed to speak my mind but bad habits are hard to break. Thank you and sorry again.,2,2020-03-18
1241,dreworbuskeridunno,"It’s difficult to wrap my head around that concept, it shouldn’t be but it is. I can’t seem to grasp why people listen to me when I speak or even acknowledge my existence. I don’t know how I have such close friends because when I look at every aspect of myself I despise all of them.",2,2020-03-18
1242,dreworbuskeridunno,But why should anyone care about what i’m going through? It’s not all that important and it could just end up making people feel awful.,1,2020-03-18
1243,dreworbuskeridunno,"You’re right, I suppose that does mean i’m gonna be sticking around for a while. Still on the fence on whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing.

As for my brain however i’d have to disagee with you. Stating the obvious doesn’t exactly show intelligence, much like admitting to having a problem doesn’t solve it and that has always been a problem for me.

Sorry I should just hold my tounge and get over it. Complaining will get me nowhere.",1,2020-03-18
1244,dreworbuskeridunno,"Thanks for thinking it doesn’t suck. Wish I could look at it without nitpicking but that’s the way the cookie crumbles. It’s good to hear that this was helpful for you as a way to vent. This did kind of help and it sort of feels good to get your feelings out in a creative outlet, so I may try doing this again but I don’t know if i’m confident enough. Thanks for posting a comment : )",1,2020-03-27
1245,dreworbuskeridunno,"Hey, it’s good to hear that you are still going. There’s not much I can say that will be of use or comfort but just know you matter and that a lot of people here in this sub are grateful you did not act on these thoughts even in your darkest hour.",1,2020-03-27
1246,dreworbuskeridunno,"I know exactly what you mean and was thinking this as I woke up today! It’s funny isn’t it? 

Suddenly it’s not such a bad thing that i’m sitting inside my room all day doing nothing productive, but infact it is actually a good thing and is exactly what the goverment here is asking of me to do.

For the first time in awhile I don’t feel immense guilt and embarrassment when I reflect on how little i’ve done in a day and it’s refreshing for a change.",1,2020-03-28
1247,dreworbuskeridunno,"Ah, that changes things. In that case please don’t overwhelm yourself to the point of wanting to break down. I understand this is important but it shouldn’t cost you your mental wellbeing. Sorry I don’t mean for that to sound bossy if it does, just wanna help but don’t exactly know what to say or do",1,2020-04-23
1248,dreworbuskeridunno,"Know the pain very well, it’s so discouraging seeing a class get on with what they’ve got infront of them no issue whilst you’re sat there feeling like your brain is going a million miles a minute and thinking too much at one time. I’m sorry that this is happening to you but speaking from experience I can say that if you need to take time away from school right now, it’s absolutely understandable.

 I don’t know if your parents/guardian know how you’re feeling but if they do they can contact your school and take it from there. You may find that you want to leave it for the time being and come back in a few months or maybe even a few years. If you do decide to leave school temporarily however long it takes just know that it is nothing to be ashamed of and it will benefit you in the long run. I hope this helps in some way, you can get through this friend!",1,2020-04-23
1249,dreworbuskeridunno,"You may be on to something there with that theory, it could be some form of repression that worked a little too well and causes your brain to slow down significantly when forming sentences. I don’t know if that even makes any sense but like I say i’m no genius, thank you for the kind words and the reminder that this struggle is not mine and mine alone.

Also holy moly 20 years! I have to commend you on sticking around for as long as you have, it fills me with a great sense of hope knowing that you can live with this. Oh and I like that you also called me friend cause I do that too. Thank you friend!",1,2020-04-23

1256,dreworbuskeridunno,Then maybe you should just go jump off a bridge instead.,1,2020-05-04
1257,dreworbuskeridunno,"Hi there, thank you for responding to this! You are so so correct in saying that life is beautiful, there is a lot to see and do and appreciate in the world, I’m just unsure if i’ll ever be able to when there’s little to no confidence in myself.

Also it is absolutely true that you have every right to ask and seek for help if you so need it. Every person does, but I have a bad habit of feeling guilty and undeserving of help when I do reach for it.

All in all though better days are going to come around. Infact this year bad days have been somewhat of a rarity in comparison to last year, only issue is when they do happen they suck big time. It’s reassuring to know that this struggle is a relatable one, definitely helps defeat the idea that these worries are invalid. Not sure what else I can say besides thank you for taking time out of your day to hear what I had to say. That’s something I never ever want to take for granted so please know that it means a lot.",2,2020-07-22
1258,dreworbuskeridunno,"Finally I can see a freaking comment, I am so sorry for not replying to you sooner this app loves to screw me over like that at times.

Thank you for saying that my suffering is valid, that fact does have to be put in front of my face sometimes since my brain doesn’t allow me to think it. This year has been crappy for pretty much everybody and there’s no reason I should be exempt from that.

And about volunteering, for a long time i’ve put off trying it. Mainly out of fear though also somewhat laziness. And that’s been the case when it comes to a lot of things, that needs to change otherwise i’m never gonna get anywhere. I gotta get out of this silly little comfort bubble and take a leap once in a while. I’m gonna look into this tommorow and see what’s available near me, even if all I do is call and enquire but still back out that’s a start. What matters is I actually try instead of laying around thinking of what could be.

As for that tip for when i’m wearing a mask, not gonna lie it’s gonna be real awkward to try and make myself emote more than usual. That’s not to say it isn’t worth a shot though

Thanks again, I appreciate that you took the time to comment :)",1,2020-10-25
1259,dreworbuskeridunno,That’s wonderful! A great way to express your innermost thoughts for sure. If you don’t mind me asking what kind of instruments/software do you play/use? I’d love to hear about it,1,2020-10-26
1260,dreworbuskeridunno,"I’m sorry to hear that, I can only hope that somehow someway you can get through any and all emotional turmoil. This year has most definitely been a challenge and a struggle for those who were already depressed and or suicidal before the event of this year began. Now more than ever helplines are the busiest they’ve ever been, especially the samaritans helpline here in the uk. And it’s heartbreaking to know the affect lockdown and the social distancing aspects are having on so many people.

I do hope that there is someone you can talk to friend, and if not then maybe one of the many 24 hour numbers you can call would be helpful. Thank you for leaving a comment and sharing your situation.",1,2020-10-26
1261,dreworbuskeridunno,"I can see the point you’re raising but i’m unclear on how it relates to this post. Wouldn’t personally say that boomers are to blame for how things are in my life, it’s more so on me and my lack of willpower.

Not trying to be rude so i’m sorry if it sounds that way",1,2020-10-26
1262,dreworbuskeridunno,"That is seriously rough, sorry to hear that you’re also having this kind of crappy experience. If nothing else we can both take comfort in the fact that we can relate on this. I wish there was more I could say to help you carry on but all I can say is that this isn’t gonna last forever. Sure it’s kinda stating the obvious but a little positive reinforcement can go a long way.

We’ve both made it this far so perhaps it’s worth seeing it through? There’s that saying “it’s going to get worse before it gets better” so theoretically once lockdown subsides and we begin to approach normality life could start looking up? Can’t be certain but i’d like to hope so",2,2020-10-26

1265,dreworbuskeridunno,"Well sadly suicide being a though I go to anytime I feel slightly negative is already an issue, it has been for quite some time. And don't get me wrong I want to keep on living for as long as I can. Deep down there is a strong minded part of me that knows life has much much more to offer me than what I have seen and been through and that it will be worth pushing through the hardships to get to it. But what I fear is that the depression will hit an extreme low and I end up doing something stupid. (to put it midly)
It has proven itself to be unpredictable with how it fucks with my emotions on a day to day basis, so I don't know what could happen. Regardless I need to try and hold on, remind myself that i'm the one in control and not this mental illness. Thank you for rooting for me and i'm sorry if i've been uncooperative today",0,2020-11-10
1266,dreworbuskeridunno,Sorry I don't follow but this sounds quite interesting. I'm guessing Jed has written about their experience with depression?,0,2020-11-10
1267,dreworbuskeridunno,Getting better? That seems like an impossibility at this juncture but I sure hope you're right. Because I don't want to ditch everybody here on earth and make people feel like shit by being dead just cause things aren't going great for me. I'll try to stop blaming myself and accepting me as I am. It won't be easy.,0,2020-11-10
1268,dreworbuskeridunno,"You could be right, and it's possible that I took for granted how easily I would subconciously be on auto-pilot for most things. It sucks because I absolutely fucking despise who I am now (not that I had a lot of self respect in the first place) and with each passing day I grow more and more uncertain of how much longer I can live like this. I don't know if I can make peace with it ya know? Sorry I must sound like a desperate nervous wreck, I'm just scared because I can't see things going any other way than the path that leads to me commiting suicide. Like no matter what I try to do I will not be able to stop it.",0,2020-11-10
1269,dreworbuskeridunno,"That part about keeping hope in your pocket reminded me of something from around April-May time 2018. That was a bad year for me, felt like I had officially lost my damn mind and was suffering some sort of an episode. Did all sorts of weird shit with no rhyme or reason like bringing the mirror from the bathroom into my room and staring into it intently (as if I expected to see someone or something who knows), waking up in a panic calling all of my friends fully convinced I had done something unforgiveable to one of them without knowing who it was or what i'd even done, sneaking out of my room window and wandering out into the night aimlessly without shoes or even socks etc. But there was this one thing I did in my desperation, I got a sticky note and wrote 'hope' on it, ripped it off the note and stuck it in the pocket of my jeans. And whenever I felt particularly hopeless i'd take it out and hold it close to me. It was weirdly therapuetic for something so literal but I think it ultimately did do a world of good, it was like a little candle of hope in this deep dank abyss of despair.

That was a bit of a tangent but yeah, depression is a bumpy ride. I dunno if 'smart as hell' is true, you're kinda giving me too much credit. And thank you for taking time to speak with me",0,2020-11-11
1270,dreworbuskeridunno,I'll keep it in mind once we shop for furniture at some point. We'll most likely go to B&amp;Q which has a pretty vast selection of gardening stuff. I could start small with a potted plant and go from there when I feel confident.,0,2020-11-11
1271,dreworbuskeridunno,"Sorry to hear that it was less than helpful for you and i'm glad you are still living. It might not have come across as gaslighting to me personally, but I can see how it would look like it.

It seems like it could be a way to perceive depression differently, maybe in a way that would help me be more accepting of it and less hateful towards myself. Sorry I hope this doesn't sound dismissive of what you said, I do hope life is going at least somewhat better than when you were younger.",0,2020-11-11
1272,dreworbuskeridunno,"Fuck... reading this is so close to home that it's like it was extracted from my brain. Happiness felt way more invigorating before I became a depressed wannabe of my former self. But I guess it shouldn't be a suprise since depression is known to make us lose interest and overall emotion. That's by far the worst of it, the numbness. At least for the first few years I could bawl my eyes out and feel something but now I cannot bring myself to cry no matter how hard I try.

There's a part of me still hanging on by a thread to hope that I can still live a fulfilling life, I think the same can happen for you too. There's more to life waiting for us, whether or not it's worth seeing is something we can't predict but there's a chance it could be miles better than the shit we're going through here and now.",0,2020-11-11

1275,fairykingz,"For me it’s like neurotypicals are at this “baseline” when they get “high” they rise above that into that particular state. For those of us like myself with neurotransmitter issues, hitting baseline almost feels like being high, and I’m tearing up writing this because even just being content in a day means so much to me and makes me see and feel just a fragment of what everyone else who doesn’t suffer from depression feel in their daily lives",2,2019-05-26

1277,fairykingz,I think it depends on who. My therapist was very helpful then vanished after prescribing me meds. The meds actually worsened and I had trouble finding someone to talk about it. Finally they show up and now I’m in a worse state than before. So from my experience if you do get one at least be confident they will be there for you for a specific amount of time to support you otherwise you will be without support (especially if prescribed meds),1,2020-11-13

I remember watching a clip from a movie or advertisement where this white guy bought a bowl of chips and sat down in a booth. He was about to eat it when he had to leave abruptly to settle some things. When he came back, there was a slightly disheveled black guy (no racism here, just typing what I remember from memory) sitting in his booth eating his chips. He was a little shocked and he sat down on the opposite side and started to eat, staring angrily at the other guy. For every chip that the black guy ate, the white guy ate twice as much. Eventually the black guy left. The white guy finished up his food and when he got up, he saw a booth with the same bowl of chips untouched. I'm sure you understand the rest from here.

You see, the black guy didn't get angry at the white guy for eating his chips. He could be thinking that this guy must have his own reason for eating my chips, be it a logical one or not. If this were to happen in normal society, anyone would have gotten up and yelled at the opposite person for stealing their food.

In the psych ward, they’d slam open the doors to your room every 15 minutes. For 72 hours. Day and night.

It was like the women got off on belittling you at every opportunity.  It’s been over a year since my experience (I’m 26F) and I’m still jaded from that experience.

As an adult—my main career interests are in fields that don’t have happen to have a lot of women (electrical maintenance) and the amount of pure distain and resistance I receive from numerous men in this line of work—it’s horrific.

They care and they hurt for you, but empathy is exhausting especially to this extent—that’s why it’s important to find a licensed professional who knows how to handle your extremes.

After accepting the cards you’ve been dealt, you can learn how to manage them. It takes time and eventually the depression becomes easier to manage. 

It’s really just like that one comic strip where the girl has a big mean wolf (depression) who always stalked her and would attack her randomly and he kept her from doing things—and it wasn’t until she had enough of his shit and starting to fight back that the wolf shrank in size and became more docile. The wolf still acted out from time to time, because it was a wolf and that’s what wolves do, but they grew to have a respectful relationship where they coexist together.

You have to accept your depression for what is and decide you don’t want to feel that way anymore. I know that sounds cliche, but as someone who was diagnosed with chronic depression and major depression—it’s true. 

Nobody is going to fix it for you. 

What helped me was Zoloft. I was on it for two years, it taught me how to relax and stop caring about things. I’ve been off of it for a year and the lessons that drug taught me remain the same, I know how to relax better than I did before. 

The depression is still there, it’s never going to go away. Chronic depression becomes a part of your personality, you grew up with it and your mind literally doesn’t know how to function without it. But it’s possible to control it, and when you take charge and decide you don’t like feeling like this anymore, the depression backs down and works with you. 

Depression is a part of you, but it doesn’t have to control you. You two can exist mutually in the same space, you take turns occupying your headspace. 

My depression leaves me alone for the most part and it mostly comes out on a daily basis as cynical humor. I still get deep depression episodes occasionally, but that’s okay. I let my depression have its moment, I hide from the world and stay in bed, and it does it’s thing and then I can I move onto the thing.
